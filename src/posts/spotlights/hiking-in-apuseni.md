Our hometown, Cluj-Napoca, is minutes away from some of the most picturesque mountains in Romania, the Apuseni mountain chain. While they are not tall, with a max altitude of 1849m at Cucurbata Mare, they are definitely the most accessible and beginner friendly mountains to hike in our country.

A lot of people from Cluj and the neighbouring cities know famous places in the mountains like: Cheile Turzii, Piatra Secuiului or Tarnita Lake. But we're going to talk today about 3 lesser-known destinations that are really capturing the beauty of this mountain chain.

## Cheile Valisoarei

The first destination is in the Trascau mountains, a limestone chain that spans along the east side of Apuseni. Cheile Valisoarei are [a bit more than 1 hour away from Cluj by car](https://goo.gl/maps/iFxuPePGPECDPoas8) on the road that passes through Rimetea, with the more famous hike at Piatra Secuiului. A few km down the valley, you pass through the Valisoara village and then the road goes straight through the Valisoara (or Aiud) Gorges. This is a paved road, so you won't have any trouble getting there.

There are two hiking options here, the right ridge and the left ridge. For the most beautiful views, we recommend the [right ridge circuit](https://muntii-nostri.ro/ro/routeinfo/circuit-cheile-valisoarei-aiudului-versantul-drept). Being a circuit, you have again two options. We hiked the opposite direction then the one described, because we weren't sure we wanted to do the whole circuit at first.

We crossed the abandoned hotel next to the road and started going up towards the edge of the cliff at 600m above sea level. The view from here is simply breath-taking and there are multiple spots from which you can see the entire left ridge in front of you.

From here the track goes pretty flat until you reach a forested where you start the climb towards the highest point of the day, at 734m. From here you get another panoramic view of the entire area, the Vaisoara village and the surrounding mountains. There's a metal cross that marks the high point.

The trickiest part of the circuit starts here as the terain is rocky and can get slippery very fast. Also, it is mostly through the forest and pretty steep in some areas. You have to be careful and have good grip in our shoes. The trail then goes over a rocky area as it exits the forest and you end up on the main road where you started.

Depending on your training and how much you stop for breaks, you can do the circuit in anything between 2 to 3 hours. The red dot marks the circuit and was recently refreshed (in 2020).

## Scarita Belioara

From Trascau, we move a bit to the north to Baisoara and Muntele Mare. Scarita Belioara is a huge rock formation at the southern end of the masif. Muntele Mare is usually accessed through Baisoara, but for Belioara, you'll have to [drive along the Aries river valley](https://goo.gl/maps/cguR3VQuK37P2AWb7) and then take a right towards Posaga de Sus. From here the road is unpaved for 8-9km until the trail, but totally driveable with a regular car. You can leave the car on the side of the road just as you arrive at the base of the mountain.

Again, there's a [red dot circuit trail](https://muntii-nostri.ro/ro/routeinfo/belioara-rezervatia-scarita-belioara-belioara) that you can follow. As a side note, when hiking in the mountains, a dot is marking circuits, while a line marks a one-way path from A to B.

Scarita Belioara is a bit more difficult then Cheile Valisoarei, because of the steepness and the total altitude difference. The hike can be done in both directions, we did as described on muntii-nostri.

As soon as you start, you need to leave the dirt road and follow the trail through a wooden door and into the woods. It took us 10-15 minutes to find this way, so having a map of the trail is super useful.

Gradually the trail becomes steeper and steeper until you reach an open rocky area, probably the steepest part of the climb. From here, you enter a beautiful forest and you keep going up until you reach a meadow with great views of the surrounding valleys. Depending on the season, you will find here different types of flowers.

The trail continues going up but with a ligher incline as you cross the second forest and you arrive at the junction with the trail that comes from Baisoara (blue cross).You are now on top of the mountain and you get beautiful views all the way to cabins in Baisoara and Muntele Cacovei. The next section of the hike is the most beautiful as you are on top of the rock formation. You can take secondary paths that lead to the edge of the cliffs for breath-taking views of the valley bellow and the Trascau Mountains in the background.

The last part of the upper trail features a half-burned forested area. The whole region is affected by wild fires from time to time unfortunately, so this is a common sight. Through this badly damaged land you start going downhill. You have to be careful here as there are a lot of fallen branches and it gets pretty steep as well.

After about 500m, you arrive at a larger forest road which makes the last part of the hike an enjoyable walk downhill. As you go down, on your right side, you will see the Cosul Boului cave. and south-eastern wall of Scarita Belioara.

All in all, the hike takes between 4 and 6 hours, depending on how much time you spend on top. We had a beautiful summer day in 2019 and we were in no hurry to finish the hike, so we did it in around 5 hours.

## Cucurbata Mare

Apuseni mountains are not known for their heights, but that does not mean you cannot have a great hiking experience going up the talled peak in the mountain range. For this final hike, you will have to be committed and start early if you want to return to Cluj in the same day, as the starting point is about 3 hours away.

The route is the same one, on Aries valley, but this time to cross into Bihor county and you drive all the way to Arieseni. As soon as you exit the village, you have to take a left and leave the paved road. Here is where the trail officially starts, [the blue line](https://muntii-nostri.ro/ro/routeinfo/valea-ariesul-mare-cucurbata-mare-vf-bihor) that goes all the way to the top of the mountain.

At 1849m, Cucurbata Mare is the highest point in the Western Carpathian mountain chain. Now, if you have a 4x4 car, you can technically drive all the way to the top of the mountain, but we recommend mixing driving a part of the trail and hiking the rest. From the full length of 8km, the first 4-5km can be done by car. You can leave your car on the side of the road at any point until here, but keep in mind that you'll be walking back on the same road.

Soon after the 4km mark, you arrive at a sharp turn in the road, where the hiking trail and the road diverge and we definitely recommend taking the trail. We left the cars pretty far out in Arieseni and walked almost the entire distance of the dirt road. It's a nice walk but you can skip it if you are short on time.

The trail starts with a pretty steep climb through a mix of forested and deforested areas. It's a pretty sustained effort uphill so it's better to be prepared with a slow and steady tempo. The upside of it is that you have a nice view of the mountain top as you go up, so you see where you are going.

As you leave the forest behind you end up on a plateau with a lot of high altitude low trees and alpine grass. The hike is still uphill, but with a lighter incline. The final part of the hike intersects the dirt road that comes around the mountain. The top reveals a beautiful 360 degrees view of the entire Apuseni mountains.
