## Introduction

The Argentinians will say their side is more spectacular because you are inches from the water. The Brazilians will argue that their side is more spectacular as you get the panoramic view of the entire area. We can only recommend that you visit both sides and decide for yourselves!

## Argentinian side

- description
- open hours
- circuits

There are two main circuits that you can walk on: the lower and upper circuits. As their name suggests, they are in both the lower and upper parts of the waterfalls. You need a full day to cover them, but it's worth it: both are spectacular. From the lower ones, you get to see a panoramic view of the falls complex, while from the upper circuit you get to really experience the waterfalls in the most attractive point: hear the roar and get wet on top of the Devil's Throat.

The panoramic viewpoint next to the Devil's Throat is a bit further in the park, but there's a train running every 15 minutes that you can take both ways to make the hike shorter. Keep in mind that temperatures of 40Â°C are not uncommon during the summer days and humidity is always above 75%.

While the entrance to the Argentinian side was quite fast, it took us a bit more to get inside the Brazilian side of the park.

The first step is to take a bus from Puerto Iguazu. There are a lot of them, every 10-15 minutes, but you can't buy tickets one day in advance. Make sure to get there as early as possible, as it gets crowded later in the day. The bus takes you to Brasil, so make sure you have your passport with you. Also, check in advance if you need a visa. The process of crossing the border, although a bit confusing, goes quite smooth, and in about an hour you are at the entrance of the "Cataratas do IguaÃ§u" Park.

There, you need to buy a ticket, then wait in a line (quite long when we were there) for another bus that takes you closer to the waterfalls. We had to wait for about an hour for the bus, but it was worth it in the end, as the weather was hot and the entire trip (one way) is of about 15km. When you get off the bus, you are right at the start of the single circuit on the Brazilian side.

Walking around takes about 2 hours, and the highpoint of this side is getting to see the Devil's Throat from below. You also get really close to the water, so you'll most probably get wet (again).

While you are on the Brazilian side, it is worth taking 1-2 hours to visit the [bird park](https://www.parquedasaves.com.br/en/), which is right next to the entrance to the national park. We were pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the species inside and by the visiting experience, as you enter the huge aviaries together with the birds and other animal species.

**Bonus: Las Tres Fronteras**

Before heading out to the airport, we took a short detour in Puerto Iguazu to see the confluence of the Iguazu and Parana rivers, and look simultaneously at three different cities in three different countries. You are standing in Argentina and looking at Brazil and Paraguay at the same time. This is quite easy to arrange with your taxi driver.
