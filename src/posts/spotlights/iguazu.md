## Introduction

At the border between Argentina and Brazil, Iguazu river creates some of the most spectacular sights in the world. In total, the Iguazu Falls complex has 275 waterfalls spread over 2700 meters. The height of the drops varies between 60 and 82 meters.

The area surrounding the falls, a subtropical rainforest, is equally important, as it's home to many species of animals and flora. To conserve it, each of the two countries has a national park. Iguaz√∫ National Park is located in the Misiones Province in Argentina, and the closest city is Puerto Iguaz√∫. On the other side of the border is the Igua√ßu National Park, located in the State of Paran√°, with Foz do Igua√ßu as the closest city.

The Argentinians will say their side is more spectacular because you are inches from the water. The Brazilians will argue that their side is more spectacular as you get the panoramic view of the entire area. We can only recommend that you visit both sides and decide for yourselves!

We visited Iguazu Falls as part of our [3 weeks trip to Argentina, Chile and Uruguay](/travel/argentina-chile-and-uruguay-in-3-weeks/), and decided to set camp (i.e., book a hotel room) in Puerto Iguaz√∫ and visit both sides of the falls from there.

## Argentinian side

There are quite a few things to do and see on this side, and you need about 6 hours to cover most of them. The park opens at 8am and closes at 6pm, with the last entrance at 4:30pm. It's better to get there as early as possible, to avoid the crowds.

You can go to the falls by taxi (it's roughly the same distance as to the airport), but there are also a lot of buses that go there every 20 minutes from [Terminal de Omnibus De Ciudad de Puerto Iguaz√∫](https://goo.gl/maps/Y5Ju35Go9UKgokV3A). Once you get to the entrance and buy your ticket, you have the full day ahead of you to enjoy the beauty of the falls.

There are two main circuits that you can walk on: the lower and upper circuits. As their name suggests, they are in both the lower and upper parts of the waterfalls. It's worth spending your entire day visiting them, as both are spectacular. From the lower ones, you get to see a panoramic view of the falls complex, while from the upper circuit you get to really experience the waterfalls in the most attractive point: hear the roar and get wet on top of the Devil's Throat.

With the thought of avoiding the crowds, we decided to quickly visit the main points of the lower circuit first. Then, we continued with the higher circuit, taking our time there. At the end of the day, we went back to some of the places that we most enjoyed in the morning. Yes, we walked a lot, but our experience was very good this way.

The beauty of the waterfalls is revealed right from the beginning of the lower circuit. Then, you get closer to the water and get to enjoy waterfalls that, in a lot of places, would be the main touristic attractions on their own. Dos Hermanas (eng. Two Sisters) is such an example, along with Bossetti waterfall. The latter can be admired from both circuits.

On the upper circuit, you get really close to the water. You hear its roar and can almost feel its power. This prepares you for the highlight of the Argentinian side visit: La Garganta del Diablo (eng. Devil's Throat).

The panoramic viewpoint next to the Devil's Throat is a bit further in the park, but there's a train running every 15 minutes that you can take both ways for free to make the hike shorter. Keep in mind that temperatures of 40¬∞C are not uncommon during the summer days and humidity is always above 75%.

This area is always crowded, and it's easy to understand why. You are on top of an 80 meters fall, very close to the water. You get wet while standing there, and can easily spend half an hour just looking at the water falling and admiring the multiple rainbows that you can see from there.

## Brazilian side

While the entrance to the Argentinian side was quite fast, it took us a bit more to get inside the Brazilian side of the park.

The first step is to take a bus from Puerto Iguazu. There are a lot of them, every 10-15 minutes, but you can't buy tickets one day in advance. Make sure to get there as early as possible, as it gets crowded later in the day. The bus takes you to Brasil, so make sure you have your passport with you. Also, check in advance if you need a visa. The process of crossing the border, although a bit confusing, goes quite smooth, and in about an hour you are at the entrance of the "Cataratas do Igua√ßu" Park.

There, you need to buy a ticket, then wait in a line (quite long when we were there) for another bus that takes you closer to the waterfalls. We had to wait for about an hour for the bus, but it was worth it in the end, as the weather was hot and the entire trip (one way) is of about 15km. When you get off the bus, you are right at the start of the single circuit on the Brazilian side.

Walking around takes about 2 hours, and the highpoint of this side is getting to see the Devil's Throat from below. You also get really close to the water, so you'll most probably get wet (again).

Without too many things to do on this side, and only one main attraction, you can't avoid the crowds. Get your mind ready for this, you need some patience to be able to enjoy the experience.

**Parque Das Aves**

While you are on the Brazilian side, it is worth taking 1-2 hours to visit the [bird park](https://www.parquedasaves.com.br/en/), which is right next to the entrance to the national park. We were pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the species inside and by the visiting experience, as you enter the huge aviaries together with the birds and other animal species.

## Travel tips

To visit Iguazu Falls you can either stay in Argentina, in Puerto Iguaz√∫, or in Brasil, in Foz do Igua√ßu. You need about one hour to get from one city to the other, and there are a lot of buses that travel between them throughout the day.

Because we visited Iguazu Falls as part of a longer trip in Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, to keep things as simple as possible, we chose to stay in Puerto Iguaz√∫. We flew there from Buenos Aires, with [Latam Airlines](https://www.latam.com/en_un/). The city itself is rather small and safe, with most of the people working in tourism or related services.

The easiest way to get from the airport to the hotel is by taxi. You pay a fixed price of about 10 euros in cash, in ARS, the Argentinian currency. The drivers are very friendly, and if you speak a bit of Spanish, you'll find out a lot about Argentina and about its people.

We stayed at one of the new(er) hotels in the city, [M√©rit Iguaz√∫](https://www.booking.com/hotel/ar/merit-iguazu.en-gb.html). The services were good, and we also had access to a rooftop swimming pool. It was the perfect ending of a day, especially after having walked a lot in the heat. The hotel is also 10 minutes away from the main bus station, [Terminal de Omnibus De Ciudad de Puerto Iguaz√∫](https://goo.gl/maps/Y5Ju35Go9UKgokV3A), from where the buses to the National Parks in both Argentina and Brasil are leaving.

There are a lot of restaurants in the city. What we enjoyed the most was [Bambu Restobar](https://g.page/bamburestobar?share). There are definitely others that are fancier, but here we enjoyed the authenticity of the people. And the food (Argentinian-style pizza) was very good.

**Bonus: Las Tres Fronteras**

Before heading out to the airport, we took a short detour in Puerto Iguazu to see the confluence of the Iguazu and Parana rivers, and look simultaneously at three different cities in three different countries. You are standing in Argentina and looking at Brazil and Paraguay at the same time. This is quite easy to arrange with your taxi driver.
