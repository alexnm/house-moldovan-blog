headline: If you want to visit Europe, you certainly have a lot of beautiful cities to discover. Paris, London, Barcelona, Prague, Amsterdam, just to name a few, are great destinations for planned city breaks and for a few days stop when touring a region. But during our travels we found that lesser known cities can offer a better visiting experience overall. We hope this article helps you discover potential destinations for the upcoming travel season, as the COVID-19 restrictions in Europe are slowly lifted.

## Strasbourg

**Why bother**

When people plan to visit a city in France, they might think of: Paris, Marseile, Nice, or Bordeaux. But our first pick on the list is Strasbourg. One of the capitals of Europe, Strasbourg lies at the crossroads of Europe, in the historic region of Alsace. It is situated in the Rhine valley, right next to the German border, on the banks of the Ill river.

**What to do**

The old town, situated on the Grande √éle should be your starting point. It is almost entirely pedestrian and is incredibly unique for a French city, due to its history of strong German influence. Architecturally speaking, the old town can easily be mistaken with a city from Southern Germany.

Strasbourg is famous for Cathedral of Our Lady, easily recognizable for its unfinished second spire. It is one of the fines examples of gothic catherdrals in the world. The first sight of the cathedral as you take a sudden turn on one of the narrow cobbled steets in the old town is breath-taking. If you are like us, you will spend hours trying to get that perfect shot of its impressive facade.

As you walk around the Old town, you will discover small cobbled streets packed with half-timbered houses. One particularly beautiful area is Petite France, around the canals of the Ill river.

Strasbourg is also a modern city, home of EU Parliament and other international institutions like the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe (not to be confused with the [European Council](https://www.coe.int/en/web/about-us/do-not-get-confused)). All of these are found in the European Quarter, a bit to the North of the old town.

All in all, Strasbourg is a wonderful destination for a city break, combining the French charm with the old German architecture. We spent 2 days there during our [Interrail](https://www.interrail.eu/) tour of Europe back in 2013 and we would love to get back some time in the near future.

## Ghent

**Why bother**

Moving to the North-West, we make a quick stop in Belgium. Stuck between the bigger Brussels and the more renown Bruges, Ghent is a city that gives you the best of the two worlds. It might not have the same picturesque sights as Bruges, but it sure is pretty. It is also a huge university center and is much more active during the evenings as young people gather around the terraces in the old town and on the banks of the canals, especially around the Graslei area.

**What to do**

The old town of Ghent is quite compact and very walkable. You can spend some time roaming the streets, discovering cute houses with small shops and restaurants. The symbol of the city is the 91m tall belfry located right next to the St. Bavo Cathedral. You can also visit the 10th century Gravensteen castle in the middle of the city, just 10 minutes away from the belfry.

The Sint-Michielsburg is also a great spot to take a snapshot before the sun goes down. As the evening comes, make sure you grab a [Gentse Tripel](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/48/12957/) or any other strong Belgian beer at one of the open terraces. We spent only a day in Ghent during the same Interrail trip back in 2013, but we would surely love to get back some time in the future.

## Wroc≈Çaw

</figure>

**Why bother**

For our third pick, we are moving to Poland. Wroc≈Çaw is usually eclipsed by Krakow, the bigger and more known city in the southern part of the country. However, we found the capital of [Silesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silesia) to be the perfect spot for getting to know the Polish culture better.

**What to do**

You can start your visit from the old market square, with its beautifully lined houses. The Old Town Hall is a beautiful example of gothic architecture and the nearby spire of St Elizabeth's Church offers a great panoramic view of the entirey market square. A bit further away from the heart of the city, you will find various small islands on the Oder river. On one of them you can visit the Wroc≈Çaw Cathedral, rebuilt after it was completely destroyed during the Second World War.

One of the main activities while in Wroc≈Çaw is [hunting dwarfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wroc%C5%82aw%27s_dwarfs). There are over 300 small figurines spread around the city in some of the most popular places. Even if you are not looking for them, you will surely find some.

We spent an evening and a full day here back in 2016 during a very hot June, as we were touring Poland and the Baltic states. It was enough to see the main spots and enjoy the relaxed vibe of the city.

## Verona

**Why bother**

Almost every city in Italy is like a museum with a mix of ancient, medieval and modern buildings, but few people recognice Verona as a city break destination. It usually goes under the radar as people go to Venice, Florence, Milano or Rome. But trust us, Verona has a lot of great spots not to be missed.

**What to do**

## Utrecht

**Why bother**

We've been to the Netherlands twice and visited a lot of cities, big and small. But Utrecht comes high of our list of a number of reasons. It is located in the central part of the country, making it the best place to stay while visiting the whole country. It also has a sizeable students population as a big university center. Finally, its city center is almost entirely car free, something you don't see in Amsterdam or other cities in the area.

**What to do**

Tour the old town with the iconic Dom, the steets lined with old houses and shops.
