## Understand

Angkor Wat is a huge temple complex located in the north-west part of Cambodia, right next to a city called Siem Reap. Most likely you will be flying into Siem Reap's International Airport and you will be staying in the city for the duration of your visit to Angkor Wat.

Tickets for Angkor Wat are sold [outside the temples area](https://goo.gl/maps/4dkejPyKGwV1HC45A), in the north-east part of the city.

## How much time do I need?

Ok, here's the thing. Angkor Wat is one of those sites where you can spend many days moving around and still not have enough time to see everything. It depends on how passionate you are about the history, culture and archeological value of the sites.

We spent 1 and a half days in total and it was really nice as we got to see most of the main sites and we spent quite some time outside of the most crowded areas, so we could enjoy the sites alone.

Tickets are sold for 1 day ($37) or for 3 days ($62). Our recommendation, if you don't have a lot of time, is to go for the day ticket and make the most out of your day there.

A lot of people recommend the sunrise at Angkor Wat, as the sun comes from behind the main temple. Expect huge crowds and the possibility of clouds which ruin the experience. We did it, but looking back, it wasn't the high point of the trip.

## Getting around

The main options for moving around inside the complex are renting tuk-tuks or bikes.

Tuk-tuks are small motorcycles that are carying a 4 seat carriage and are pretty comfortable as you spend the time between the temples sitting down under a shading roof. The drivers don't speak fluent english, but understand basic words and know the area really well. If you go with this option, you will rent a driver for the entire day and all you have to do is remember their face as you go to the parking lot outside each temple you visit.

Renting a bike is fun, but can be quite challenging under intense heat and long distances. We rented bikes for our full day and had a great time going from temple to temple. We had a tuk-tuk for the second day as we wanted to catch the sunrise and get back to the hotel by lunch time.

## Stops

Angkor Wat is the name of the entire area, but it's also the name of the main temple, the one most people can recognize before they even set foot in Cambodia. It is so important for the country, that they put it on the flag: üá∞üá≠.

However, there are a lot of other temples really worth visiting during your stay. Here's a quick guide on things you should not miss in Angkor Wat.
