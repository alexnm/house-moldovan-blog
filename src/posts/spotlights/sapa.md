## Introduction

Sapa or Sa Pa, is a small town in Lao Cai Province. It is close to the Chinese border, at about 350 km from Hanoi. The town is located in the Hoang Lien Son mountain range, which includes Fan Si Pan peak, the highest in the entire country.

There are usually a lot of tourists going to Sapa, mostly for the beautiful treks and the iconic rice fields. On top of this, the region is very interesting as it's home to different ethnic groups. Meeting the people is what impressed us the most.

## How to get there

If you're traveling on your own, there are a few options to get to Sapa from Hanoi. The one that's recommended a lot is by night train. The trip from Hanoi to Lao Cai takes about 9 hours, and then from there you can go to Sapa by minibus or by taxi. Another option is to book a transfer with a tourism agency. A minibus will take you from your hotel in Hanoi (if you're staying in the Old Town) and will leave you at your hotel in Sapa. If you're used to riding a motorcycle, that's definitely an option too, as the road goes through beautiful regions. The ride should take around 9-10 hours in total.

We visited Sapa as part of our [longer trip in Vietnam and Cambodia](/travel/south-east-asian-adventure/). We had a 2-day trip to Sapa booked with a [local company](https://www.getyourguide.com/activity/hanoi-l205/2-day-sapa-bus-tour-from-hanoi-and-sapa-hotel-stay-t49881) from before our holiday started. They took care of everything: arranged a bus transfer, made sure we had all meals included and planned our hiking activities.

The bus from Hanoi to Sapa takes about 6 hours, and it definitely is an experience on its own, especially because of the chaotic driving. There was no guide with us on the road, and the driver didn't speak English, but that was not an issue. In our opinion, being taken from our hotel in Hanoi and being dropped of at the hotel in Sapa was really comfortable and helpful.

## Ethnic diversity

Depending on how much time you have and on your physical condition, there are several activities that you can do in Sapa. They range from half-day hikes, quite easy to do for anyone, to multiple day treks. They usually include visiting at least a village in the area, besides the actual hiking part, and there is a very good reason for that.

Sapa is home to five ethnic minorities of Vietnam: H‚Äômong (Mong Den, or Black Mong), Dao Do (Red Dao), Tay or Choang (Zhuang), Giay (Dzay), and Xa Pho. They can be recognized by the beautiful distinctive clothes they wear.

Each minority has its own story and its own traditions, and being able to see them in their authentic environment is just wonderful.

## Activities

Having only two days in Sapa, we tried to make the most of them. Our local guide, whom we met shortly after arriving at our hotel in Sapa, helped us a lot with that. Her name is Nh∆∞ (pronounced like the English word 'new'). Born and raised in one of the villages in the area, she is one of the Black H‚Äômong ethnic people. That's the biggest minority in Sapa with about 53% of the population in the area.

In the first day, we visited the Cat Cat village, home of the Black H‚Äômong. The village is located near the bottom of a deep valley at the foot of Fansipan Peak. From there, we went to the bottom of the valley, to see a beautiful waterfall and a hydraulic power station built by the French.

We preferred to walk back to the hotel, a 2.5km distance, mostly uphill, but not difficult at all. In total, the entire visit took around 3 hours. This helped us stay in shape for the longer trek in our second day in Sapa.

Although the early morning was foggy, we were quite lucky in the end and got to see entire mountains covered with rice terraces. We visited Lao Chai and Ta Van village, homes of Black H‚Äômong and Dzay people. The trek itself was not difficult, but it was long enough that we really enjoyed our lunch at a local restaurant in Ta Van. Our way back to Sapa was by bus, followed by another long bus trip to Hanoi.

## Our experience

The landscape is beautiful, but what impressed us most is how the locals lived. Nh∆∞ explained a lot about that, and even took us inside some locals homes. We have to say that for us that was a life-changing experience - our perception of poor and simple living was never the same again.

Also, people there have a sense of hard work and perseverance that is not easy to find in the wealthier countries nowadays. Such an example is the fact that Nh∆∞ is a self-taught English speaker, with a lot of knowledge of the area. A surprising thing for us was that until we met her, she had never been to Hanoi.

## Travel tips

We hope this paints a good picture of what Sa Pa is about. At the end, here are a couple of useful tips that we can share about our experience.

A lot of locals that live in the area are quite poor. That's why some of them, especially women, will follow you around in your trips. Be ferm when telling them you don't need their services, but also be polite.

If you want to help the local community (it's highly recommended!), the best way to do that is by buying handmade things from them. Do not buy from and do not give money to children - you might indirectly be encouraging them to drop out of school.

Local guides are underpaid. Tip them if you can, they need it to make a living. Nh∆∞ definitely deserved it.

Listen to their stories, and don't be shy. People are curious to learn about where you come from, they'll ask questions, so it's perfectly fine if you do that too.
