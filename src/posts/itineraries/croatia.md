## Day 1: Zagreb

Back in the summer of 2017, we went on a road trip in Croatia and Montenegro. On the first day, we had a very long drive from our hometown - Cluj-Napoca, Romania to Pula, Croatia. On the way, we had a three hours stop in Zagreb, to refresh and have a first glimpse of the country.

Zagreb is the capital and the largest city in Croatia, dating from the Roman times. Its old city center is well-known for the 18th and 19th century Austro-Hungarian architecture. That's the most touristy area, and that's where we spent our time.

The first impressive building that we saw was St. Mark's Church, a 13th century monument. It has typical croatian patterns on its roof, along with the coat of arms of Croatia, Slavonia and Dalmatia on the left, and the city of Zagreb on the right side. From there, we walked to the Cathedral of Zagreb, the tallest building in Croatia and also the most impressive gothic church southeast of the Alps.

There was definitely more to see and do in Zagreb, but that story is for another time.

## Day 2: Pula

Pula is the biggest city in the Istria peninsula and its main administrative center. It's right on the coast of the Adriatic sea, and has a lot of [beautiful beaches](https://www.croatia-expert.com/beaches-in-pula/). We decided to start our day relaxing there. We ended up enjoying the high waves at the Gortanova Uvala beach and jumping from one of the rocks right next to it. Don't worry, it's not dangerous, even 10-12 year old children were doing that. From there, we walked on the Ambrela beach, and stopped there for more swimming. (Everyone can tell by now that we are not really the sunbathing type of people.)

In the afternoon, we were up for cultural sightseeing. The city dates back from the Roman period, and still has a lot of standing monuments from that time. We started from the Arch of the Sergii or the Golden Gate, which is very well preserved and marks the entrance to the old Roman city. The road took us to the Forum, the main square, where we visited the Temple of August, built in the first century.

By far, the most impressive monument is the Roman Amphitheatre. It is the sixth biggest amphitheatre in the world, and one of the best preserved. Also called Pula Arena, it hosts a lot of concerts as well as the Pula film festival.
