## Day 1: Hanoi

Most good travels start with a long flight, and this is no exception. We landed in Hanoi at 7am, and at 9am we were on the hotel rooftop terrace, eating breakfast and enjoying a coffee and fresh fruits.

In the quick two hours we had our first look in the Vietnamese culture. The driver was trying hard to speak English with us and to show us a few things on the way. The roads were busy and the intersections were crazy - "Made in Vietnam" as the driver used to say. All these, along with the hospitality of the hotel staff, gave us the feeling that we would find out more about the world than what we planned for.

Hanoi is a truly living city. It is home for about 8 million people, and this makes it have it all: from the old quarter with narrow streets to green parks to fancy new shopping malls. Especially in the old quarter, you see narrow houses on many levels. A lot of people are cooking and eating in the street. In the evening, they gather around for food and drinks around very small tables on the sidewalk.

We always felt safe, and walked around quite a lot. As a European, you need to re-learn how to cross the street (we had our 1-minute training at the hotel reception). Keep a steady pace, don't stop and don't run, and try to make eye-contact with the people riding the motorcycle.

**Recommended activities**:

- Just walk around the old quarter, observe the people and enjoy the atmosphere
- Eat pho and spring rolls at a local restaurant
- Head to Hoan Kiem Lake and Ngoc Son Temple
- Visit Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (there you can see Ho Chi Minh's "conserved" body)

## Days 2-3: Sapa

After spending our first day in Hanoi, we left the city for a two-day visit in rural Vietnam, up-north, in the mountainous region of Sapa. There, we got to see entire mountains covered with rice terraces. The landscape is beautiful, but what impressed us most is how the locals lived. You can read more about the ethnic diversity in Sa Pa in our [spotlight](https://housemoldovan.com/travel/ethnic-diversity-in-sa-pa/) article.

## Days 4-5: Ha Long Bay

If the first trip was booked online from home, for our next one we decided to wait and do the booking in Hanoi. The staff at the hotel helped with that, they recommended a local agency and helped us decide between the various options. Keep in mind that everything is negotiable in Vietnam, so do your homework before booking a trip :)

Most of the trips in Vietnam take care of the bus transfers and all your meals, and this was no exception. After a few hours of crazy driving, this time on a very busy road, we reached Ha Long Bay and went on board of a nice boat. And then the amazing views started to show themselves.

Besides enjoying the beautiful landscape, we attended some activities organized by the crew. We really enjoyed kayaking around the lovely Tra Bau area, even if it was the first time we tried that together. Also, we attended a spring rolls cooking lesson and a Vietnamese tea ceremony. They were both fun and very informative.

The road back to Hanoi was equally crazy, and it was followed by a quite crowded flight to Ho Chi Minh City.

## Days 6-8: Ho Chi Minh City

We landed quite late, but from the very beginning we could tell that Ho Chi Minh City is very different from Hanoi. Formerly called Saigon, it is known for its role in Vietnam War, and also for its French colonial buildings.

In total, we spent three days here, and we used the time to get the vibe of the city, to visit some rural areas around it and to understand more about the war.

### War Remnants Museum & Cu Chi Tunnels

After having spent a few days in the nature, our apetite for culture was quite high. So we hopped on a guided full-day trip to the historic center of Ho Chi Minh City and to the famous Cu Chi Tunnels.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/vietnam/saigon-notre-dame.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Notre Dame Cathedral in Ho Chi Minh City.</figcaption>
</figure>

The tour covered the Notre Dame Cathedral and a 19-th century post office built by the French. The Reunification Palace and the War Remnants Museum followed, and were really impressive. They made us understand a lot about the American War in Vietnam - as it's called throughout the museum.

The visit to the museum is very educational. You learn about the context in which everything started, and about the main events during the war. We expected the exhibits to be more biased, but were pleasantly surprised by the fact-based explanations. They presented how each party viewed the war and how that influenced its course. Also, a lot of famous photos from the Vietnamese and foreign press were being exhibited. Although it's a very sad experience, we loved the optimistic vibe at the end. Without doubt, they managed to get past the war, even if its consequences are still visible.

Our next stop was at the underground network of Cu-Chi tunnels. They were used by Viet Cong during the war, and a lot of the Vietnamese people life was happening inside. They even had some "rooms" they used as schools. We were able to enter in one of the tunnels (one of the larger ones), and were struck by how small they actually were. It's definitely not an experience for claustrophobic people, but if you can physically do it, we highly recommend it.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/vietnam/cu-chi-tunnels.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

Another activity that you can't do somewhere else is shoot a few bullets with a weapon of your choice, out of a few that were used in the war. We tried an AK-47, and shot about ten bullets. It was the first time we shot a gun, so starting directly with an AK-47 was probably not the wisest thing (although it was safe). Also, hearing these shots while walking inside the Cu-Chi tunnels area adds to the experience in a scary but good way.

### Visiting the city

After getting a glimpse of the city in the first day, it was now time to actually feel its vibe. We started with a very good Vietnamese coffee at Trung NguyÃªn Legend CafÃ© (a local chain), then we walked around the old city just observing how people live. We did not miss the famous Ben Thanh Street Food market, with its variety of colors and smells.

HCMC definitely is crowded, but it's better spaced compared to Hanoi. The wide boulevards (a legacy of the French colonial times), the big squares and the large buildings make it clear that the city is the financial capital of Vietnam.

</figure>

The city is alive, both during the day and the night. The area around People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City is especially crowded during the evening. It seems to be "the walking place" for a lot of youngsters and families alike. If there is one place in Vietnam where we did not feel the communist vibe at all, this is definitely it.

**Recommended activities**:

- walk around the city center, both during the day and during the evening
- have a Vietnamese coffee, with condensed milk, at a local coffee shop
- grab a snack at Ben Thanh Market

### Mekong Delta

For our last day in the area, we went rural again. We booked a guided trip to Mekong Delta, but it was actually a lot more than that.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/vietnam/buddha-mekong.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Happy Buddha statue at Vinh Trang Temple.</figcaption>
</figure>

It started with the Vinh Trang Pagoda, a famous Buddhist temple that has three huge statues of Buddha. Then, the trip continued by motorized boat on the Tien River to the Qui (Tortoise Islet), followed by a cruise on the Bao Dinh canal. We also had a stop at the Ben Tre province. It's called "the land of coconuts", a perfect place to buy (and eat) a lot of coconut candies - they are awesome.

Last but not least, we took a short trip on a rowing boat on one of the small canals of Mekong Delta. It's a beautiful experience, as we got to see some remote places that were otherwise inaccessible. The people "driving" the boat are highly skilled, so it's all safe. Even so, seeing other boats come towards you can give you an unease feeling and an adrenaline rush.

## Days 9-12: Cambodia

After seeing the two main centers of Vietnam, with both the urban and rural areas around them, we took a flight to Siem Reap. As we read before in some traveling articles, the most unpleasant experience that you have in Cambodia is at the airport. That's very true, because of the queues, because of all the forms that you need to fill in, and because of the unfriendly people there. But don't worry, that ends quite fast, and gets a lot better as soon as you step outside the airport :)

The climate is very hot and humid in March, and there are a lot of insects and small animals all over the place. Still, the hotel was the cleanest we had in our entire trip, and we got used to using insect repellent all day long. Also, we had a car booked to drive us to the hotel, and the driver was the most cheerful man. He also ended up driving our tuk-tuk to Ankgor Wat, but about that, a bit later.

### Siem Reap countryside

For our first full day in Siem Reap, we booked a guided tour in the rural areas around Siem Reap, that included the Kompong Khleang Floating Village.

We chose a local agency, and that was the best decision that we could take. Our guide, John, a local Cambodian guy in his early twenties, was very knowledgeable. He explained a lot about the local culture and how things changed for them in the recent history. Together with a small group, we biked through a village and visited the local market (and ate some goodies that John recommended). The terrain was flat, so it was not difficult to do that in spite of the heat. Also, we were greeted by a lot of children along the road. They were very nice and curious. As John explained, saying "hello" was their way of getting in contact with the tourists, even if that was all the English they spoke.

</figure>

This experience was followed by the visit to Kompong Khleang, one of the floating villages where the community is still authentic. We were there in the dry season, so we started the visit by walking in the village. Then we had a traditional Khmer lunch at a local family in one of the pillar houses. This was followed by a boat trip on the TonlÃ© Sap lake, that offered revealing views of both the village and the lake.

### Angkor Wat

Days two and three (more like two and a half) in Cambodia were reserved for Angkor Wat, a huge temple complex close to Siem Reap. Being the former capital of the Khmer Empire, Angkor Wat is a unique destination in terms of architecture, history and pure beauty.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/cambodia/angkor-wat.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

We spent as much time as we could in the area, and we definitely recommend all travelers to visit it. To read more on our itinerary and our visiting options, check out our [spotlight article](https://housemoldovan.com/travel/exploring-the-temples-of-angkor-wat/).

## Days 13-15: Phu Quoc

When planning the trip, we knew that we would be tired after two weeks of traveling, so we decided to book a few days to relax on the beach. There was some back and forth regarding the maxim number of days we could spend at the beach without dying of boredom :)

We chose to spend those days in Phu Quoc, in a remote resort in the western part of the island, not even close to the main city. We had our own bungalow, very close to the sea.

Being in the Gulf of Thailand, the island has fine sand and blue warm water. It's rightfully called Vietnam's Pearl Island. Swimming there was great both during the day and the night.

<figure>

At about 1km away from the resort there was a beach that offered a very nice sunset view, with the sun disappearing in the sea. That was our only time outside the resort, and it was worth it. The beach was empty, and we were able to enjoy an amazing sunset all by ourselves.

## Day 16: Hanoi

When we had to go back to Hanoi for our flight home, we started to really feel that our trip was coming to an end. With one day left in Hanoi, we decided to visit another area than what we saw before. We ended up "climbing" (via an elevator) on the [Lotte Observation Deck](https://lottecenter.com.vn/eng/observation/overview.asp) - a sky walk located at the 65th floor of the Lotte Tower.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/vietnam/lotte-tower-view.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

We spent the rest of the day buying souvenirs (read: a lot of coffee) for home. Also, we couldn't help but eat yet another bowl of pho - and we loved it once again!

## Travel tips

As almost all our trips, this one was a self-organized trip. We didn't know too much about the region and about how tourist-friendly it was, but we did our homework. Here are some of the things that we found out, some of them during the planning phase and others while being there.

**Visas**

Both Vietnam and Cambodia require visas for a lot of foreign countries. Check if you need one in advance.

Vietnam has tourist visas with single and multiple entries, make sure you choose the right one depending on your itinerary. There are a lot of companies that take care of all the documentation. They send you the visa approval paper, together with exact instructions on the next steps that you need to take. Make sure to follow them to make the process smoother: have the required amount of cash upon arrival, along with two passport-size photos. We used [Vietnam Visa Online](https://www.vietnam-visaonline.org/) and paid 26USD for each person. That is on top of the actual cost of the visas that need to be paid when you enter the country, around 25USD per person.

The Cambodian government has a [website](http://evisa.gov.kh/) where you can apply for the visa directly. This is a straight-forward process. At the end, you receive a pdf via email where all the next steps are described (what to print, how many copies etc). The visa fee (36USD pp in our case) needs to be paid online when applying for the visa.

**Transportation**

To travel internally in Vietnam and also from Vietnam to Cambodia and back, we chose to fly with Vietnam Airlines. This was money well spent, as we had no issues, always left and arrived on time. We did not travel with Vietjet, but read reviews speaking of delays and canceled flights, and we didn't want to take that chance. A good way of saving some money is if you book multiple flights at the same time - you only pay the quite expensive processing fees once. Also, be aware that a lot of people in Vietnam travel with their small children. The flights are not necessarily quiet, but there is a lot of effort to keep the kids entertained, so it's not bad either. The only annoying thing is that the luggage usually takes a lot to arrive, and a lot of people carry cardboard boxes as luggage. This is the reason why they are checked at the way out of the airport, and it of course adds some time to your schedule.

To travel from the airport to the hotel we usually booked the trip in advance with the hotel staff. Beware that they don't send a taxi, they send a car with a driver they have a contract with. The quality of the drive is usually better than with a regular cab, and it's also a bit more expensive. The average cost for such a ride is 15USD.

Inside the city feel free to take an Uber, they're a lot cheaper than what the hotels offer, and quite good. Make sure to check if you want a car or a motorcycle.

In Cambodia, a tuk-tuk is also a very good option. Tuk-tuks are small motorcycles that are carrying a 4 seat coach and are pretty comfortable.

**Currencies**

In both Vietnam and Cambodia, you will need to change some money into the local currency. There are some places where you can pay in USD though, as it is the preferred foreign currency.

In Vietnam, they have the Vietnamese Dong, but because of the past inflation, the numbers that they operate with are huge. 1 USD equals around 23000 VND. Check the exchange rate before going to an exchange office. As mentioned earlier, everything is negotiable in Vietnam, including this.

In Cambodia, the currency is called Riel. 1 USD equals around 4100 KHR. In Siem Reap, the 1 dollar bill will get you a lot of basic goods, and you can pay a lot more with USD compared to Vietnam. Expect to get the change in KHR though.

**Hotels**

The rule of thumb that we followed when it comes to hotels was: make sure it's well located and clean. The prices are quite low compared to the European ones, with around 35USD / double room / night we were able to find very good places. Don't go for lower than that, as some hotels can be quite sketchy. Of course, there are a lot of luxury hotels as well, but we preferred to spend the money differently.

For their services especially, we highly recommend [La Selva hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-jasmine.en-gb.htm) in Hanoi. We stayed there for just one night, because they had no room available for the night between our two trips to Sapa and Ha Long Bay. They moved our luggage from one hotel to the other at no extra cost, and also came to greet us in the morning before we left for Ha Long Bay.

[Shadow Angkor Residence](https://www.booking.com/hotel/kh/shadow-angkor-residence.en-gb.html?aid=304142) in Siem Reap was the best we had during our entire trip. Very clean, great smelling room and very good services offered by the staff.

All hotels have safe boxes. Make sure to use them, it's a lot easier to walk around in the crowds without worrying about your passports or money. We had a few copies of our passports with us, and carried "a pair" of those in our wallets. They also come in handy as some hotels also need to keep either the passport or a copy of it for the duration of your stay.

**Food**

Food in Vietnam is a-ma-zing. You need to try at least the traditional [pho soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pho) and [spring rolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_roll#Vietnam) - they come in different options: fresh or deeply fried, vegetarian or with meat. Also, coconut water drank from a coconut nut is very good (especially if it's cold).

<figure>
  <img src="/img/vietnam/food.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Traditional lunch in Vietnam.</figcaption>
</figure>

In Cambodia, you will be able to try a lot of strange things, like bugs, snakes and other creatures. We are not that brave when it comes to food, so we just took a look at them :)

Especially in the tropical areas, make sure you stay hydrated. That means drinking water and also eating salty foods, which will make you drink even more water. Soy sauce is your friend.

Tap water is usually not safe to drink. Make sure you have bottled water with you at all times (the hotels usually offer a few bottles a day, and also all the day trips have that covered).

**Other recommendations**

The local tourism agency that we chose in Cambodia and that exceeded our expectations is [Triple A Cambodia](https://tripleacambodia.com/).

Make sure to pack a sun protection cream with a high SPF (at least 30) because the sun really is burning. Also, an insect repellent is very useful, but you can find very good ones there (a lot better than the one we packed from home).

To know more about the region, there were two books that we read:

- [Catfish and Mandala: A Two-Wheeled Voyage Through the Landscape and Memory of Vietnam](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4370.Catfish_and_Mandala) by Andrew X. Pham
- [Pierdut Ã®n Vietnam & Cambodgia](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30255894-pierdut-in-vietnam-cambodgia) by CÄƒtÄƒlin Vrabie (this in only in Romanian)

**General atmosphere**

It probably is obvious by now that we really enjoyed the time we spent in both Vietnam and Cambodia. We wish to go back there some day :)

We went there for the history, architecture and the beautiful nature. We came back home with a nice feeling of having met wonderful people along the way. We always felt safe and welcome. We were curious about the local culture, and people were quite open about it. The fact that we learned a few words in the local language (how to say hello and thank you) also helped a lot, especially with the people that did not really speak English and were trying to.
