## Day 1: Hanoi

Most good travels start with a long flight, and this is no exception. We landed in Hanoi at around 7am, and at around 9am we were on the hotel rooftop terrace eating breakfast and enjoying a coffee and fresh fruits.

In the quick two hours we had our first look in the Vietnamese culture. The driver who was trying hard to speak English with us and to show us a few things on the road, the busy roads and the crazy intersections ("Made in Vietnam" as the driver used to say), the hospitality of the hotel staff - these all gave us a very good reassuring feeling that we would get to find out a lot more about the world in the two weeks that we had planned.

Hanoi is a truly living city. It is home for about 8 million people, and this makes it have it all: from the old quarter with narrow streets to green parks to fancy new shopping malls. Especially in the old quarter (but not only), you get to see narrow houses on multiple levels, with people cooking and eating in the street. In the evening, they gather around for food and drinks around very small tables on the sidewalk.

We always felt safe, and walked around quite a lot. As a European, you need to re-learn how to cross the street (we had our 1-minute training at the hotel reception): keep a steady pace, don't stop and don't run, and try to make eye-contact with the people on the motorcycle coming towards you.

**Recommended activities**:

- Just walk around the old quarter, observe the people and enjoy the atmosphere
- Eat pho and spring rolls at a local restaurant
- Head to Hoan Kiem Lake and Ngoc Son Temple
- Visit Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (there you can see Ho Chi Minh's "conserved" body)

## Days 2-3: Sapa

After spending our first day in Hanoi, we left the city for a two-day visit of rural Vietnam, up-north, in the mountainous region of Sapa.

We previously booked this trip with a local company, and they took care of everything: arranged a bus transfer, made sure we had all meals included and planned our trekking activities.

The bus from Hanoi to Sapa takes about 6 hours, and it definitely is an experience on its own, mostly because of the crazy driving. With that out of the way, we arrived in Sapa, and were dropped of at a really nice hotel. After having lunch there, we met our local guide and started the first trekking session: we first visited the Cat Cat village, home of the Black Hâ€™mong ethnic people and located near the bottom of a deep valley at the foot of Fansipan Peak. From there, we went to the bottom of the valley, to see a beautiful waterfall and a hydraulic power station built by the French.

The landscape is beautiful, but what impressed us most is how the locals lived. Our guide was a young woman named NhÆ° (pronounced just like the English word 'new'), born and raised in one of the villages in the area. She was able to explain a lot of how people actually lived there, and she also took us inside some locals homes. We have to say that for us that was a life-changing experience - our perception of poor and simple living was never the same again. Also, people there have a sense of hard work and perseverence that is not easy to find in the wealthier countries nowadays. Such an example is the fact that NhÆ° is a self-taught English speaker, with a lot of knowdlege on the area, even if until we met her, she had never been to Hanoi.

On our second day in Sapa we went on a longer trek and we got to actually see entire mountains covered with rice terraces. We visited Lao Chai and Ta Van village, homes of Black Hmong and Dzay people. The trek itself was not difficult, but it was long enough so that we really enjoyed our lunch at a local restaurant in Ta Van. Our way back to Sapa was by bus, followed by another long bus trip to Hanoi.

## Days 4-5: Ha Long Bay

If the first trip was booked online from home, for our next one we decided to wait and do the booking in Hanoi. The staff at the hotel helped with that, they recommended a local agency and helped us decide between the various options. Keep in mind that everything is negotiable in Vietnam, so do your homework before booking a trip :)

Most of the trips in Vietnam take care of the bus transfers and all your meals, and this was no exception. After a few hours of crazy driving, this time on a very busy road, we reached Ha Long Bay and went on board of a nice boat. And then the amazing views started to show themselves :)

Besides enjoying the landscape of limestone karst mountains and islands from various places on the boat, there were some other activities organized by the crew. We really enjoyed kayaking around the lovely Tra Bau area, even if it was the first time we tried that together. Also, we attended a spring rolls cooking lesson and a Vietnamese tea ceremony, both were fun and very informative.

The road back to Hanoi was equally crazy, and it was followed by a quite crowded flight to Ho Chi Minh City.

## Days 6-8: Ho Chi Minh City

We landed quite late, but from the very beginning we could tell that Ho Chi Minh City is very different from Hanoi. Formerly called Saigon, it is known for its role in Vietnam War, and also for its French colonial buildings.

In total, we spent three days here, and we used the time to get the vibe of the city, to visit some rural areas around it and to understand more about the war.

### War Remnants Museum & Cu Chi Tunnels

After having spent a few days in the nature, our apetite for culture was quite high. So we hopped on a guided full-day trip to the historic center of Ho Chi Minh City and to the famous Cu Chi Tunnels.

<figure>

</figure>

The tour covered the Notre Dame Cathedral and a 19-th century post office built by the French, followed by the Reunification Palace and the War Remnants Museum. These last two were really impressive and they made us understand a lot about the American War in Vietnam, as it's called throughout the museum.

The visit to the museum is very educational. You get to understand the context in which everything started, the main events during the war, and also how each party viewed it and how that influenced its course. We expected the exhibits to be more biased, but were pleaseantly surprised by the fact-based explanations. Also, a lot of famous photos from the Vietnamese and foreign press were being exhibited. Although it's a very sad experience overall, we loved the optimistic vibe at the end: clearly, they managed to get past the war, even if its consequences are still visible.

Our next stop was at the underground network of Cu-Chi tunnels. They were used by Viet Cong during the war, and a lot of the Vietnamese people life was happening inside: they even had some "rooms" they used as schools. We were able to enter in one of the tunnels (one of the larger ones), and were struck by how small they actually were. It's definitely not an experience for claustrophobic people, but if you can physically do it, we highly recommend it.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/vietnam/cu-chi-tunnels.jpg" alt="">

</figure>

Another activity that you can't do somewhere else is shoot a few bullets with a weapon of your choice, out of a few that were used in the war. We tried an AK-47, and shot about ten bullets. It was the first time we shot a gun, so starting directly with an AK-47 was probably not the wisest thing (although it was safe from all other aspects). Also, hearing these shots while walking inside the Cu-Chi tunnels area adds to the experience in a scary but good way.

### Visiting the city

After getting a glimpse of the city in the first day, it was now time to actually feel its vibe. We started with a very good Vietnamese coffee at Trung NguyÃªn Legend CafÃ© (it's a chain, you find the coffee shops throughout the city), then we walked around the old city just observing how people live. We did not miss the famous Ben Thanh Street Food market, with its variety of colors and smells.

HCMC definitely is crowded, but it's better spaced compared to Hanoi. The wide boulevards (a legacy of the French colonial times), the bigger squares and the larger buildings make it clear that the city is truly the financial capital of Vietnam.

</figure>

The city is alive, both during the day and the night. The area around People's Committee of Ho Chi Minh City is especially crowded during the evening - it seemed to be "the walking place" for a lot of youngsters and families alike. If there is one place where we did not feel the communist vibe at all, this is it.

**Recommended activities**:

- walk around the city center, both during the day and during the evening
- have a Vietnamese coffee, with condensed milk, at a local coffee shop
- grab a snack at Ben Thanh Market

### Mekong Delta

For our last day in the area, we went rural again. We booked a guided trip to Mekong Delta, but it was actually a lot more than that.

<figure>

</figure>

It started with the Vinh Trang Pagoda, a famous Buddhist temple that has three huge statues of Buddha. Then, the trip continued by motorized boat on the Tien River to the Qui (Tortoise Islet), followed by a cruise on the Bao Dinh canal. We also had a stop at the Ben Tre province â€” "the land of coconuts" where, we bought (and ate) a lot of coconut candies, they are just awesome.

Last but not least, we took a short trip on a rowing boat on one of the small canals of Mekong Delta. It's a beautiful experience, as we got to see some remote places that were inaccessible otherwise. The people "driving" the boat are highly skilled, so it's all safe, but seeing other boats come towards you can give you an unease feeling and an adrenaline rush.

## Days 9-12: Cambodia

After seeing the two main centers of Vietnam, with both the urban and rural areas around them, we took a flight to Siem Reap. As we previously read in some traveling articles, the most unpleasant experience that you have in Cambodia is in the airport. That's very true, because of the queues, because of all the forms that you need to fill in, and because of the unfriendly people there. But don't worry, that ends quite fast, and gets a lot better as soon as you step outside the airport :)

The climate is very hot and humid in March, and there are a lot of insects and small animals all over the place. However, the hotel was the cleanest we had in our entire trip, and we got used to using insect repellent all day long. Also, we previously booked a car do drive us to the hotel, and the driver was the most cheerful man. He also ended up driving our tuk-tuk to Ankgor Wat, but about that, a bit later.

### Siem Reap countryside

For our first full day in Siem Reap, we booked a guided tour in the rural areas around Siem Reap, that included the Kompong Khleang Floating Village.

We chose a local agency, and that was the best decision that we could take. Our guide, John, a local Cambodian guy in his early twenties, was very knowledgeable and explained a lot about the local culture and how things changed for them in the recent history. Together with a small group, we biked through a village and visited the local market (and ate some goodies that John recommended). The terrain was flat, so it was not difficult to do that in spite of the heat. Also, we were greeted by a lot of children along the road, they were very nice and curious and (as John explained) saying "hello" was their way of getting in contact with the tourists, even if that was all the English that they spoke.

</figure>

This experience was followed by the visit to Kompong Khleang, one of the floating villages where the community is still authentic. We were there in the dry season, so we started the visit by walking in the village, and then we had a traditional Khmer lunch at a local family in one of the pillar houses. This was followed by a boat trip on the TonlÃ© Sap lake, that offered revealing views of both the village and the lake.

### Angkor Wat

Days two and three (more like two and a half) in Cambodia were reserved for Angkor Wat, a huge temple complex close to Siem Reap. Being the former capital of the Khmer Empire, Angkor Wat is a unique destination in terms of architecture, history and pure beauty.

<figure>

We spent as much time as we could in the area, and we definitely recommend all travelers to visit it. To read more on our itinerary and our visiting options, check out our [spotlight article](https://housemoldovan.com/travel/exploring-the-temples-of-angkor-wat/).

## Days 13-15: Phu Quoc

When planning the trip, we knew that we would be tired after two weeks of traveling, so we decided to book a few days to relax on the beach. There was some back and forth regarding the maxim number of days we could spend at the beach without dying of boredom :)

We chose to spend those days in Phu Quoc, Vietnam's Pearl Island, in a remote resort in the western part of the island, not even close to the main city. We had our own bungalow, very close to the sea.

Being in the Gulf of Thailand, the island has fine sand and blue warm water. Swimming was great both during the day and the night.

At about 1km away from the resort there was a beach that offered a very nice sunset view, with the sun disappearing in the sea. That was our only time outside the resort, and it was worth it. The beach was empty, and we were able to enjoy an amazing sunset all by ourselves.

## Day 16: Hanoi

When we had to go back to Hanoi for our flight home, we started to really feel that our trip was coming to an end. With one day left in Hanoi, we decided to visit another area than what we previously saw. We ended up "climbing" (via an elevator) on the [Lotte Observation Deck](https://lottecenter.com.vn/eng/observation/overview.asp) - a sky walk located at the 65th floor of the Lotte Tower.

<figure>

We spent the rest of the day buying souvenirs (read: a lot of coffee) for home. Also, we couldn't help but eat yet another bowl of pho - and we loved it once again!

## Travel tips

- flights
- taxi / Uber / tuk-tuk
- visas
- currencies and changing money
- hotels

For their services especially, we highly recommend [La Selva hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-jasmine.en-gb.htm). For our night between the two trips we had to stay in another place, but they moved our luggages from one hotel to the other at no extra cost, and also came to greet us in the morning before we left for Ha Long Bay.

- safety
- general atmosphere
