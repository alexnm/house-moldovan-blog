headline: South East Asia means much more than its rich history and beautiful nature. Exploring Vietnam and Cambodia was for us an opportunity to understand the values of two countries that went through war in their recent history and found the strength to recover from it. Check out our 16-days experience in 4 four different regions - Hanoi, Ho-Chi-Minh City, Siem Reap and Phu Quoc island.

## Day 1: Hanoi

Most good travels start with a long flight, and this is no exception. We landed in Hanoi at around 7am, and at around 9am we were on the hotel rooftop terrace eating breakfast and enjoying a coffee and fresh fruits.

In the quick two hours we had our first look in the Vietnamese culture. The driver who was trying hard to speak English with us and to show us a few things on the road, the busy roads and the crazy intersections ("Made in Vietnam" as the driver used to say), the hospitality of the hotel staff - these all gave us a very good reassuring feeling that we would get to find out a lot more about the world in the two weeks that we had planned.

Hanoi is a truly living city. It is home for about 8 million people, and this makes it have it all: from the old quarter with narrow streets to green parks to fancy new shopping malls. Especially in the old quarter (but not only), you get to see narrow houses on multiple levels, with people cooking and eating in the street. In the evening, they gather around for food and drinks around very small tables on the sidewalk.

We always felt safe, and walked around quite a lot. As a European, you need to re-learn how to cross the street (we had our 1-minute training at the hotel reception): keep a steady pace, don't stop and don't run, and try to make eye-contact with the people on the motorcycle coming towards you.

**Recommended activities**:

- Just walk around the old quarter, observe the people and enjoy the atmosphere
- Eat pho and spring rolls at a local restaurant
- Head to Hoan Kiem Lake and Ngoc Son Temple
- Visit Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum (there you can see Ho Chi Minh's "conserved" body)

## Days 2-3: Sapa

After spending our first day in Hanoi, we left the city for a two-day visit of rural Vietnam, up-north, in the mountainous region of Sapa.

We previously booked this trip with a local company, and they took care of everything: arranged a bus transfer, made sure we had all meals included and planned our trekking activities.

The bus from Hanoi to Sapa takes about 6 hours, and it definitely is an experience on its own, mostly because of the crazy driving. With that out of the way, we arrived in Sapa, and were dropped of at a really nice hotel. After having lunch there, we met our local guide and started the first trekking session: we first visited the Cat Cat village, home of the Black Hâ€™mong ethnic people and located near the bottom of a deep valley at the foot of Fansipan Peak. From there, we went to the bottom of the valley, to see a beautiful waterfall and a hydraulic power station built by the French.

The landscape is beautiful, but what impressed us most is how the locals lived. Our guide was a young woman named NhÆ° (pronounced just like the English word 'new'), born and raised in one of the villages in the area. She was able to explain a lot of how people actually lived there, and she also took us inside some locals homes. We have to say that for us that was a life-changing experience - our perception of poor and simple living was never the same again. Also, people there have a sense of hard work and perseverence that is not easy to find in the wealthier countries nowadays. Such an example is the fact that NhÆ° is a self-taught English speaker, with a lot of knowdlege on the area, even if until we met her, she had never been to Hanoi.

On our second day in Sapa we went on a longer trek and we got to actually see entire mountains covered with rice terraces. We visited Lao Chai and Ta Van village, homes of Black Hmong and Dzay people. The trek itself was not difficult, but it was long enough so that we really enjoyed our lunch at a local restaurant in Ta Van. Our way back to Sapa was by bus, followed by another long bus trip to Hanoi.

## Days 4-5: Ha Long Bay

If the first trip was booked online from home, for our next one we decided to wait and do the booking in Hanoi. The staff at the hotel helped with that, they recommended a local agency and helped us decide between the various options. Keep in mind that everything is negotiable in Vietnam, so do your homework before booking a trip :)

Most of the trips in Vietnam take care of the bus transfers and all your meals, and this was no exception. After a few hours of crazy driving, this time on a very busy road, we reached Ha Long Bay and went on board of a nice boat. And then the amazing views started to show themselves :)

Besides enjoying the landscape of limestone karst mountains and islands from various places on the boat, there were some other activities organized by the crew. We really enjoyed kayaking around the lovely Tra Bau area, even if it was the first time we tried that together. Also, we attended a spring rolls cooking lesson and a Vietnamese tea ceremony, both were fun and very informative.

The road back to Hanoi was equally crazy, and it was followed by a quite crowded flight to Ho Chi Minh City.

## Days 6-8: Ho Chi Minh City

We landed quite late, but from the very beginning we could tell that Ho Chi Minh City is very different from Hanoi. Formerly called Saigon, it is known for its role in Vietnam War, and also for its French colonial buildings.

In total, we spent three days here, and we used the time to get the vibe of the city, to visit some rural areas around it and to understand more about the war.

### War Remnants Museum & Cu Chi Tunnels

After having spent a few days in the nature, our apetite for culture was quite high. So we hopped on a guided full-day trip to the historic center of Ho Chi Minh City and to the famous Cu Chi Tunnels.

The tour covered the Notre Dame Cathedral and a 19-th century post office built by the French, followed by the Reunification Palace and the War Remnants Museum. These last two were really impressive and they made us understand a lot about the American War in Vietnam, as it's called throughout the museum.

The visit to the museum is very educational. You get to understand the context in which everything started, the main events during the war, and also how each party viewed it and how that influenced its course. We expected the exhibits to be more biased, but were pleaseantly surprised by the fact-based explanations. Also, a lot of famous photos from the Vietnamese and foreign press were being exhibited. Although it's a very sad experience overall, we loved the optimistic vibe at the end: clearly, they managed to get past the war, even if its consequences are still visible.

Our next stop was at the underground network of Cu-Chi tunnels. They were used by Viet Cong during the war, and a lot of the Vietnamese people life was happening inside: they even had some "rooms" they used as schools. We were able to enter in one of the tunnels (one of the larger ones), and were struck by how small they actually were. It's definitely not an experience for claustrophobic people, but if you can physically do it, we highly recommend it.

Another activity that you can't do somewhere else is shoot a few bullets with a weapon of your choice, out of a few that were used in the war. We tried an AK-47, and shot about ten bullets. It was the first time we shot a gun, so starting directly with an AK-47 was probably not the wisest thing (although it was safe from all other aspects). Also, hearing these shots while walking inside the Cu-Chi tunnels area adds to the experience in a scary but good way.

## Travel tips

- flights
- taxi / Uber / tuk-tuk
- visas
- currencies and changing money
- hotels

For their services especially, we highly recommend [La Selva hotel](https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/the-jasmine.en-gb.htm). For our night between the two trips we had to stay in another place, but they moved our luggages from one hotel to the other at no extra cost, and also came to greet us in the morning before we left for Ha Long Bay.

- safety
- general atmosphere
