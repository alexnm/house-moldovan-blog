## Tel Aviv / Jaffa

The economic heart of Israel **Tel Aviv** and the old city of **Jaffa/Yafo** are basically a single urban mix of old and new. From millennia old sandstone buildings to modern steel and glass skyscrapers, enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of the entire city, especially during the evenings.

## Haifa, Akko, Caesarea

Going north from Tel Aviv, along the Mediterranean coast, you have a lot of impressive old cities and natural landscapes to visit. Distances in Israel are pretty small and the highway network is quite good, so you are able to do a lot in a day.

## Jerusalem Old Town

Whether you are a believer or not, Jerusalem is one of the destinations you have to reach at least once in your lifetime. The legends, the history, the birth of Abrahamic religions, it's all centered around this city, that in turn is considered holy by jews, muslims and christians alike. Get ready for some serious walking and make sure your knees are in good shape for some ups and downs.

## Temple Mount

This whole area on the East side of the old town is run by the Jordanian military and has a pretty strict visiting schedule, but we encourage everyone to take the time and wonder around as it is truly a unique place. The Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque are built during the islamic rule on top of the ruins of the Second Jewish Temple. For muslims, it's the third holiest site in the world after Mecca and Medina. For jews, it's the constant reminder of their lost temple. Sadly, it is also one of the centers of discord between the two groups.

## Mount of Olives

On the other side of the town, lies a hill packed with religious meaning for christianity.

## Eilat and the Red Canyon

At the southern-most point of Israel, Eilat is the capital of sunny days and sea activities. With an amazing shoreline at the Red Sea and the north-most coral reef in the world, tourists are welcome to enjoy a variety of water sports and activities.

## Wadi Rum Desert

Not far from the Red Sea, but crossing into Jordan, you get to the red desert of Wadi Rum, in the land of bedouins, camels and rocky sand mountains. We had an amazing stay at the Mohammed Mutlak Bedouin Camp and we did a desert tour with 4x4 pick-up trucks which was a surreal experience.

## Petra

Images cannot really capture the beauty of Petra and the amazing rock carvings done here in the time of the Nabataeans. A huge site with numerous hiking options, Petra requires at least a day to explore and wonder at the amazing rock and desert colors.
