## TEL AVIV & JAFFA

The economic heart of Israel **Tel Aviv** and the old city of **Jaffa/Yafo** are basically a single urban mix of old and new. From millennia old sandstone buildings to modern steel and glass skyscrapers.

### Highlights

- Tel Aviv Promenade - walking north to south on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
- Casually walking up and down the Allenby and Rothschild Boulevards.
- Amazing hummus and falafel at Hummus Abu Dabi.
- Just enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of the entire city, especially during the evenings.
- Old city of Jaffa with a great viewpoint over Tel Aviv.
