## Days 1-3: Tokyo

Welcome to the most populous city in the world! With close to 38 milion inhabitants, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo) is an incredible urban center.

For moving around, we definitely recommend the [Tokyo Metro Pass](https://thecupandtheroad.com/2016/09/26/tokyo-subway-day-pass-ticket/), which is available only for visitors. It is quite cheap when looking at the prices for individual tickets and will give you unlimited access to the busiest public transportation system in the world. And while the subway system looks overwhelming at first, it is by far the most organized and well signaled system we ever used. A mobile app of the system is super helpful when planning your trip from A to B, because most likely you will have to change lines.

Fun fact, there is no city officially named Tokyo. The urban area was split into multiple cities, or [wards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo). The most popular are the ones closest to the geographical center of the area: Chiyoda, Ch≈´≈ç, Minato, Tait≈ç, Shinjuku and Shibuya.

Now, walking is an option and you will do a lot of it during your visit, but you will need public transportation to move from one ward to another.

With this in mind, we spent the first two days in Tokyo wandering around some of the most popular wards. And for our third day we used our backup plan for indoor activities as we had a rainy day.

### Chiyoda

The heart of the city is built around the Imperial Palace, main residence of the emperor of Japan. However, since the area around the Imperial Palace is not open for visitors and the rest of the city is a financial district, you should not waste too much time around.

One interesting area in the north part of Chiyoda you should definitely visit is Akihabara, famous for its [maid cafes](https://hubjapan.io/articles/5-best-maid-cafe-in-akihabara-in-tokyo-you-should-visit). While there, you should also check the [Yodobashi electronic store](https://goo.gl/maps/tJzK4hq8kPrHQ9ph6) with its seven stories featuring an incredible variety of products.

### Tait≈ç

Further north, Tait≈ç is a more relaxed borough. Two of the most visited spots in Tokyo can be found here: Ueno Park and Sens≈ç-ji temple.

We first went to Ueno, but before entering the park we stopped at local market next to the train lines, for some authentic street food. We definitely recommend this place, it's called [Ameya Yokocho Market](https://goo.gl/maps/X7nRsgXRrjRa2BtD7) and it is the perfect introduction into the japanese urban culture.

Then we did a quick tour of the park, one of the most popular ones in Tokyo during sakura. However, we were there a couple of days earlier and the cherries were not yet in full blossom. Nevertheless, it's a great spot that should definitely be on your map when visiting Tokyo.

In the second part of the day, we visited one of the oldest neighbourhoods of Tokyo, Asakusa, built around the ancient buddhist temple of Sens≈ç-ji, the oldest one in Tokyo.

### Minato

Next day we started with a short walk in Minato, a big ward situated in the southern part of the city.

### Shinjuku

### Shibuya

### Koto
