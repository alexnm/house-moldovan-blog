## Days 1-3: Tokyo

Welcome to the most populous city in the world! With close to 38 milion inhabitants, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo) is an incredible urban center.

<figure>

</figure>

For moving around, we definitely recommend the [Tokyo Metro Pass](https://thecupandtheroad.com/2016/09/26/tokyo-subway-day-pass-ticket/), which is available only for visitors. It is quite cheap when looking at the prices for individual tickets and will give you unlimited access to the busiest public transportation system in the world. And while the subway system looks overwhelming at first, it is by far the most organized and well signaled system we ever used. A mobile app of the system is super helpful when planning your trip from A to B, because most likely you will have to change lines.

<div class="info tip">
  <span>The Tokyo Metro Pass can be bought from both Narita and Haneda airports.</span>
</div>

Fun fact, there is no city officially named Tokyo. The urban area was split into multiple cities, or [wards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo). The most popular are the ones closest to the geographical center of the area: Chiyoda, Ch≈´≈ç, Minato, Tait≈ç, Shinjuku and Shibuya.

Now, walking is an option and you will do a lot of it during your visit, but you will need public transportation to move from one ward to another.

With this in mind, we spent the first two days in Tokyo wandering around some of the most popular wards. And for our third day we used our backup plan for indoor activities as we had a rainy day.

### Chiyoda

The heart of the city is built around the **Imperial Palace**, main residence of the emperor of Japan. However, since the area around the Imperial Palace is not open for visitors and the rest of the city is a financial district, you should not waste too much time around.

One interesting area in the north part of Chiyoda you should definitely visit is **Akihabara**, famous for its [maid cafes](https://hubjapan.io/articles/5-best-maid-cafe-in-akihabara-in-tokyo-you-should-visit). While there, you should also check the [Yodobashi electronic store](https://goo.gl/maps/tJzK4hq8kPrHQ9ph6) with its seven stories featuring an incredible variety of products.

### Tait≈ç

Further north, Tait≈ç is a more relaxed borough. Two of the most visited spots in Tokyo can be found here: **Ueno Park** and **Sens≈ç-ji** temple.

We first went to Ueno, but before entering the park we stopped at local market next to the train lines, for some authentic street food. We definitely recommend this place, it's called [Ameya Yokocho Market](https://goo.gl/maps/X7nRsgXRrjRa2BtD7) and it is the perfect introduction into the japanese urban culture.

Then we did a quick tour of the park, one of the most popular ones in Tokyo during sakura. However, we were there a couple of days earlier and the cherries were not yet in full blossom. Nevertheless, it's a great spot that should definitely be on your map when visiting Tokyo.

In the second part of the day, we visited one of the oldest neighbourhoods of Tokyo, Asakusa, built around the ancient buddhist temple of Sens≈ç-ji, the oldest one in Tokyo.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Sens≈ç-ji is the oldest surviving temple in Tokyo.</figcaption>
</figure>

Not far from Asakusa, you can also visit [Tokyo Skytree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree), which at 634m is the second tallest structure in the world after Burj Khalifa. However, be prepared for a hefty ticket price. When we were there in 2017 it was about 20 USD.

### Minato

Next day we started with a short walk in Minato, a big ward situated in the southern part of the city. Minato is probably famous for **Tokyo Tower**, its landmark structure that resembles the Eiffel Tower. Truth be told, it doesn't even come close to the Eiffel Tower, although the red-white color scheme does look beautiful and it is nicely floodlighted in the evenings.

There are multiple buildings which offer a panoramic view of the city, and Tokyo Tower is one of them. However, we decided to skip it. It is not that expensive at around 8 USD, but we had a recommendation for another viewpoint, which we will talk about later ;)

<figure>

</figure>

Close to the tower, we stopped by another fine example of traditional Japanese architecture at the **Zojoji Temple**, another buddhist temple from the 17th century.

Minato also features some very modern areas like Roppongi Hills and Shiodome, full of office towers and high end residential buildings.

### Shinjuku

A visit to Tokyo is not complete without spending a few hours in Shinjuku. For us, it felt like this is the heart of the city, especially during the evenings and late nights when the clubs and karaoke bars open.

But there's more. Shinjuku is also a major train and bus hub and also a major economic and political center for the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Speaking of that, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building, or Tocho as the Japanese call it, offers 360 views of the entire city. There are two towers and each have an elevator to the 55th floor. The best part? it's free and one of them is open until 10pm if you like the night views.

<figure>

</figure>

Also a fun fact, you get a direct view to the Park Hyatt Hotel, which was heavily featured in [Lost in Translation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/). By the way, we highly recommend the movie before visiting Japan for the first time. Even if it's not about Japan, you get some insights on the Japanese culture.

After starring at the city for a while, we decided to take a walk through the busy streets below us. Shinjuku is one of the many places in Japan where it's just fun to walk and observe the people and their habbits and to absorbe the unique culture of the country. We took a quick tour of a [Pachinko parlor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko) and we stopped by the [giant Godzilla head](https://www.tokyocreative.com/articles/19691-godzilla-in-shinjuku-japans-world-famous-monster-is-about-to-destroy-tokyo-once-again) on top of the Toho building, owned by the same company that is behind the original movies.

</figure>

We ended our tour of the neighbourhood in **Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden**. We haven't been to New York yet, but this is the closest thing we saw to Central Park. There are many things that make this park unique in Tokyo and it was probably our favorite relaxation spot during our trip. It is one of the biggest parks in Tokyo, it has a lot of beautiful gardens in different international styles and a lot of open areas.

</figure>

There's a small entrance fee, but that is perfect as it ensures the place is never too crowded, not even during sakura.

### Shibuya

Further south lies Shibuya, another ward not to be missed while in Tokyo. We walked from Shinjuku Gyoen to another green area of Tokyo, this time split in two between the Shinto shrine of **Meiji Jingu** and **Yoyogi Park**. The latter is another popular spot during sakura and is usually packed with young people and families practicing various outdoor sports.

We then continued our walk towards the famous **Shibuya crossing**. And yes, we walked a lot during that day! The center of Shibuya is another bustling area, packed with restaurants, shopping centers and office buildings. And then you get to the crossing, considered the world busiest pedestrian crossing, with an estimate of 2500 people crossing at one time. After crossing a couple of times, because why not? we went to a shopping center and took this video from above:

Yep, that's life in Tokyo. We finished the day in the Japanese style, hiting an [Izakaya pub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya) in Shibuya.

### Koto

The third day - wow, it's been only two days since we arrived - was rather ugly, with constant rain and fog, so we decided to spend it indoor. If you find yourself in this situation when you visit, or if you are passionate about museums in general, you should definitely check out **Miraikan**, or the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation. They offer incredible exhibitions, great educational materials and a chance to see [Asimo](https://global.honda/innovation/robotics/ASIMO.html) in action.

<figure>

The museum is located on an island in another district, called Koto, a bit farther from central Tokyo, in harbour area. In order to get there, you can hop on to an automated light rail transit service called [Yurikamome](https://www.yurikamome.co.jp/en/).

The island also houses a few big shopping malls so we spent some time in there. Later, we also found a [Toyota museum](https://goo.gl/maps/TUrowiZWxvTYBmst7) and it was a nice experience overall.
