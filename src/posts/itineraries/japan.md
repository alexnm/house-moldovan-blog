## Days 1-3: Tokyo

Welcome to the most populous city in the world! With close to 38 milion inhabitants, the [Tokyo Metropolitan Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo) is an incredible urban center.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/tokyo-panoramic.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Tokyo seen from the Metropolitan Government Building.</figcaption>
</figure>

For moving around, we definitely recommend the [Tokyo Metro Pass](https://thecupandtheroad.com/2016/09/26/tokyo-subway-day-pass-ticket/), which is available only for visitors. It is quite cheap when looking at the prices for individual tickets and will give you unlimited access to the busiest public transportation system in the world. And while the subway system looks overwhelming at first, it is by far the most organized and well signaled system we ever used. A mobile app of the system is super helpful when planning your trip from A to B, because most likely you will have to change lines.

<div class="info tip">
  <span>The Tokyo Metro Pass can be bought from both Narita and Haneda airports.</span>
</div>

Fun fact, there is no city officially named Tokyo. The urban area was split into multiple cities, or [wards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_wards_of_Tokyo). The most popular are the ones closest to the geographical center of the area: Chiyoda, Ch≈´≈ç, Minato, Tait≈ç, Shinjuku and Shibuya.

Now, walking is an option and you will do a lot of it during your visit, but you will need public transportation to move from one ward to another.

With this in mind, we spent the first two days in Tokyo wandering around some of the most popular wards. And for our third day we used our backup plan for indoor activities as we had a rainy day.

### Chiyoda

The heart of the city is built around the **Imperial Palace**, main residence of the emperor of Japan. However, since the area around the Imperial Palace is not open for visitors and the rest of the city is a financial district, you should not waste too much time around.

One interesting area in the north part of Chiyoda you should definitely visit is **Akihabara**, famous for its [maid cafes](https://hubjapan.io/articles/5-best-maid-cafe-in-akihabara-in-tokyo-you-should-visit). While there, you should also check the [Yodobashi electronic store](https://goo.gl/maps/tJzK4hq8kPrHQ9ph6) with its seven stories featuring an incredible variety of products.

### Tait≈ç

Further north, Tait≈ç is a more relaxed borough. Two of the most visited spots in Tokyo can be found here: **Ueno Park** and **Sens≈ç-ji** temple.

We first went to Ueno, but before entering the park we stopped at local market next to the train lines, for some authentic street food. We definitely recommend this place, it's called [Ameya Yokocho Market](https://goo.gl/maps/X7nRsgXRrjRa2BtD7) and it is the perfect introduction into the japanese urban culture.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/tokyo-ueno.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Lake inside Ueno Park.</figcaption>
</figure>

Then we did a quick tour of the park, one of the most popular ones in Tokyo during sakura. However, we were there a couple of days earlier and the cherries were not yet in full blossom. Nevertheless, it's a great spot that should definitely be on your map when visiting Tokyo.

In the second part of the day, we visited one of the oldest neighbourhoods of Tokyo, Asakusa, built around the ancient buddhist temple of Sens≈ç-ji, the oldest one in Tokyo.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/tokyo-senso-ji.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Sens≈ç-ji is the oldest surviving temple in Tokyo.</figcaption>
</figure>

Not far from Asakusa, you can also visit [Tokyo Skytree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Skytree), which at 634m is the second tallest structure in the world after Burj Khalifa. However, be prepared for a hefty ticket price. When we were there in 2017 it was about 20 USD.

### Minato

Next day we started with a short walk in Minato, a big ward situated in the southern part of the city. Minato is probably famous for **Tokyo Tower**, its landmark structure that resembles the Eiffel Tower. Truth be told, it doesn't even come close to the Eiffel Tower, although the red-white color scheme does look beautiful and it is nicely floodlighted in the evenings.

There are multiple buildings which offer a panoramic view of the city, and Tokyo Tower is one of them. However, we decided to skip it. It is not that expensive at around 8 USD, but we had a recommendation for another viewpoint, which we will talk about later ;)

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/tokyo-tower.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Tokyo tower in the background, through blooming cherry branches.</figcaption>
</figure>

Close to the tower, we stopped by another fine example of traditional Japanese architecture at the **Zojoji Temple**, another buddhist temple from the 17th century.

Minato also features some very modern areas like Roppongi Hills and Shiodome, full of office towers and high end residential buildings.

### Shinjuku

A visit to Tokyo is not complete without spending a few hours in Shinjuku. For us, it felt like this is the heart of the city, especially during the evenings and late nights when the clubs and karaoke bars open.

But there's more. Shinjuku is also a major train and bus hub and also a major economic and political center for the Tokyo Metropolitan Area. Speaking of that, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building, or Tocho as the Japanese call it, offers 360 views of the entire city. There are two towers and each have an elevator to the 55th floor. The best part? it's free and one of them is open until 10pm if you like the night views.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/tokyo-panoramic-2.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>High-rise buildings in Shinjuku, seen from Tocho.</figcaption>
</figure>

Also a fun fact, you get a direct view to the Park Hyatt Hotel, which was heavily featured in [Lost in Translation](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335266/). By the way, we highly recommend the movie before visiting Japan for the first time. Even if it's not about Japan, you get some insights on the Japanese culture.

After starring at the city for a while, we decided to take a walk through the busy streets below us. Shinjuku is one of the many places in Japan where it's just fun to walk and observe the people and their habbits and to absorbe the unique culture of the country. We took a quick tour of a [Pachinko parlor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachinko) and we stopped by the [giant Godzilla head](https://www.tokyocreative.com/articles/19691-godzilla-in-shinjuku-japans-world-famous-monster-is-about-to-destroy-tokyo-once-again) on top of the Toho building, owned by the same company that is behind the original movies.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/tokyo-shinjuku-night.jpg" alt="Colorful buildings during the night in Shinjuku">
  <figcaption>Shinjuku is literally the brightest neighbourhood in Tokyo.</figcaption>
</figure>

We ended our tour of the neighbourhood in **Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden**. We haven't been to New York yet, but this is the closest thing we saw to Central Park. There are many things that make this park unique in Tokyo and it was probably our favorite relaxation spot during our trip. It is one of the biggest parks in Tokyo, it has a lot of beautiful gardens in different international styles and a lot of open areas.

<figure>

  <figcaption>Shinjuku Gyoen is the perfect spot for admiring the nature inside the urban jungle.</figcaption>
</figure>

There's a small entrance fee, but that is perfect as it ensures the place is never too crowded, not even during sakura.

### Shibuya

Further south lies Shibuya, another ward not to be missed while in Tokyo. We walked from Shinjuku Gyoen to another green area of Tokyo, this time split in two between the Shinto shrine of **Meiji Jingu** and **Yoyogi Park**. The latter is another popular spot during sakura and is usually packed with young people and families practicing various outdoor sports.

We then continued our walk towards the famous **Shibuya crossing**. And yes, we walked a lot during that day! The center of Shibuya is another bustling area, packed with restaurants, shopping centers and office buildings. And then you get to the crossing, considered the world busiest pedestrian crossing, with an estimate of 2500 people crossing at one time. After crossing a couple of times, because why not? we went to a shopping center and took this video from above:

</figure>

Yep, that's life in Tokyo. We finished the day in the Japanese style, hiting an [Izakaya pub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izakaya) in Shibuya.

### Koto

The third day - wow, it's been only two days since we arrived - was rather ugly, with constant rain and fog, so we decided to spend it indoor. If you find yourself in this situation when you visit, or if you are passionate about museums in general, you should definitely check out **Miraikan**, or the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation. They offer incredible exhibitions, great educational materials and a chance to see [Asimo](https://global.honda/innovation/robotics/ASIMO.html) in action.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/tokyo-miraikan.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Crowd gathered to see Asimo's show.</figcaption>
</figure>

The museum is located on an island in another district, called Koto, a bit farther from central Tokyo, in harbour area. In order to get there, you can hop on to an automated light rail transit service called [Yurikamome](https://www.yurikamome.co.jp/en/).

The island also houses a few big shopping malls so we spent some time in there. Later, we also found a [Toyota museum](https://goo.gl/maps/TUrowiZWxvTYBmst7) and it was a nice experience overall.

## Days 4-9: Kansai Area

The area around Kyoto and Osaka is called **Kansai** and is one of the most visited regions of Japan. So the second leg of our journey began with a 2 hour 40 minutes train ride with the **Shinkansen**, the japanese bullet-train. We took the train from Tokyo to Kyoto, the old capital of Japan.

Keep in mind that the train covers over 500km in that timespan, it's quite an experience. Also, keep in mind that trains are pretty expensive in Japan, so be ready to pay over 100 EUR for one long distance ticket. A cheaper alternative, if you don't care that much about the travel time is to use buses. More on that later ...

<div class="info tip">
  <span>To travel inside the region, we recommend the <a href="https://www.surutto.com/tickets/kansai_thru_english.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kansai Pass</a>, a super cheap multi-day ticket that gives you access to trains, subways and buses.</span>
</div>

Local trains within the region are incredibly convenient. We stayed for six nights at a guesthouse, about half-way between Osaka and Kyoto and we were always 25 to 35 minutes away from the two city centers.

Speaking of saying overnight, we had a great experience at guesthouse, the owners are super kind and will help you out with anything you need during your stay. They speak fluent english and travelled all over the world so they can be really helpful when it comes to explaining cultural differences between Japan and the rest of the world. And believe us, there are a lot of them!

### Himeji & Kobe

For the first day, we decided to visit Himeji, the western-most destination in Kansai. The city is famous for the **Himeji Castle**, one of the most visited sights in the entire country.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/himeji.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>One of the best examples of medieval architecture in Japan.</figcaption>
</figure>

You can visit the courtyard and the castle itself, all the way to the top floor. Quite an interesting experience. But keep in mind that it is a very popular destination, so expect to see a lot of people during the visit.

On the way back from Himeji, we stopped at the **Akashi Kaikyo Bridge**, the longest suspension bridge in the world, connecting the main islands Honshu and Shikoku.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/akashi-kaikyo-bridge.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>And one of the best examples of modern architecture in Japan.</figcaption>
</figure>

And since we were in the area, we finished the day in **Kobe**. We stopped there to enjoy the world famous Kobe beef at [one of the steakhouses](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g298562-d6656920-Reviews-Steak_Land_Kobekan-Kobe_Hyogo_Prefecture_Kinki.html) in the city and we strolled around the port area.

Kobe, Osaka and the surrounding cities form one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country, the second one after Tokyo, with over 20 million inhabitants.

### Nara & Osaka

We started the second day of our Kansai region tour in **Nara**, another former capital of Japan. Nara is famous for its old temples and shrines and for its deer! Yes, deer roam freely in the old part of Nara, transformed in the late 19th century into the Nara Park.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/nara-deer.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>There are special crackers that you can buy for the deer!</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="info tip">
  <span>The deer are hungry and active in the morning, trying to steal the crackers from your hands, but become lazy as the day advances.</span>
</div>

A must-stop in Nara is the **T≈çdai-ji** buddhist temple, which houses the largest bronze statue of Buddha in the world. We also recommend a nice walk uphill towards the **Kasuga-taisha** shrine, a beautiful example of shinto architecture.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/nara-temple.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>A lot of people gather at T≈çdai-ji during a regular visit day</figcaption>
</figure>

After this, we moved to Osaka for the rest of the afternoon and evening. We had dinner in the popular **D≈çtonbori** area and we walked around the incredibly crowded shopping area of downtown Osaka. Make sure you catch the billboard of the runner crossing the finish line, it somehow become the modern symbol of the city.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/osaka-dotonbori.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Yes, it's a crowded city, as most of the big cities in Japan.</figcaption>
</figure>

The city is comparable with Tokyo, but people here are very proud of their city and of all the small cultural differences between them and the capital. Other popular areas in are: Namba, Umeda and around Osaka Castle.

We wrapped our evening at the Umeda Sky Building, which offers a 360 panorama of the entire city from its 40th floor. Amazing views during the night! The location is also convenient, as the Umeda train station has direct connects to the neighbouring areas.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/osaka-night-panorama.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Incredible night panorama of the Osaka metropolitan area.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Kyoto

Ok, we've been in Kansai for two days, but didn't get to visit Kyoto yet. Kyoto is famous for its temples and shrines and for pretty much being the essential stop for cultural tourism in Japan.

You need around 3-4 days if you want to cover all the spots in Kyoto. Even though the city is not that big, its major attractions are spread around and public transportation is not as efficient as in Tokyo or Osaka. There are a few subway lines and regional trains to travel a bit outside the city.

Unfortunately, while we were there during sakura, the cherries in Kyoto were not in full bloom. Apparently, they bloomed a bit later then expected that year. Plus, the weather was not the friendliest one, so we got a bit of rain here and there. But overall, it was a great experience.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/kyoto-golden-pavilion.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Kinkaku-ji, or the Golden Temple, is one of the most famous stops in Kyoto.</figcaption>
</figure>

The two main religions in Japan are buddhism and shinto. They are both heavily represented with beautiful shrines and temples in Kyoto. The buddhist temples have beautifully decorated gardens around them, making them really popular during the high season.

<div class="info tip">
  <span>In short, temples are buddhist, while shrines are shinto. However, it is very common for local people to pray both in temples and shrines, as they don't consider themselves strictly buddhist or shinto</span>
</div>

Temples are recognized by the presense of **Buddha** statues either outside or inside the main building. Shrines are more open and don't have large closed buildings. They are easily recognizable by the **Torii** gates (usually painted in bright red) that you pass under, on your way to them.

#### Buddhist Temples

The Golden Temple, the Silver Temple, Kiyomizu-dera and Ry≈çan-ji are just a few of the most popular spots that should not be missed while in Kyoto. They are all buddhist temples, most of them belong to the Zen branch of buddhism.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/kyoto-ryoan-ji.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Beautiful garden arrangement at Ryoan-ji Temple.</figcaption>
</figure>

Make up your schedule so that you also have time to wander around lesser known temples. They usually offer a more relaxed and authentic visiting experience, without the crowds and the noise. While visiting the Arashiyama district, we randomly stopped at [Giouji Temple](https://goo.gl/maps/XXJb1AMS8CGPSSqHA), rarely found on tourist maps, and we were amazed by its beautiful garden. We're pretty sure this is not an exception, so give it a try anywhere you are.

#### Mount Kurama

If you spend that extra day in Kyoto, we highly recommend a trip just outside the city, to **Mount Kurama**. There's a local train that takes you north of the city, in a heavily forested area.

Here you will find beautiful temples and shrines and a hiking trail up to **Kurama-dera Temple**, situated at the top of the mountain. Going over the mountain, you can reach the **Kifune Shrine**, another beautiful example of shinto architecture.

#### Fushimi Inari

Speaking of shrines, probably the most visited spot in Kyoto is the **Fushimi Inari Taisha** Shrine. This one is famous for its endless Torii gates that cover the pathways up and down the hill.

<div class="info warning">
  <span>Make sure you plan enough time for Fushimi Inari, as the site is huge and there are a lot of stairs to go up and down</span>
</div>

And even though the site is huge, it is also super popular all day long, so expect to see a lot of people going up and down the stairs, trying to take the perfect shot though the gates. We mixed our trip to Mount Kurama with the visit to Fushimi Inari in the same day and it was a long and exhausting one! So make sure you plan enough time in between to fully enjoy the sights.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/kyoto-fushimi-inari.jpg" alt="Looking through the red torri gates at Fushimi Inari">
  <figcaption>It takes a lot of effort to take a picture with no one in the frame!</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Arashiyama

In the west part of the city, you can find the Arashiyama bamboo forest, another very picturesque spot in Kyoto. This is also an area where you can find a lot of smaller temples, worth checking out.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/kyoto-arashiyama.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>Bamboo forest in Arashiyama</figcaption>
</figure>

As you cross over the Katsura river, you can enter the Arashiyama Monkey Park. Situated on a hill, this site offers great views towards the city. It is also a place where you can spot the local macaques and even feed them bananas and other treats you can buy from there. However, keep in mind that these are wild animals, try to keep your distance and behave responsibly around them.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/japan/kyoto-arashiyama-monkey.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption>A local macaque waiting for the photoshoot to end</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Gion

Last but not least, Gion is the famous geisha district in Kyoto. It has a unique vibe and can be packed with tourists at all times. Great food in the area as well. The neighbourhood also has beautiful wooden houses, lined with craft shops.

Keep in mind that the ladies you see dressed up are mostly tourists and not geishas. The real geishas do not walk along the streets and they are very discreet with their public appearance. If you see one sneaking towards a car or out from a restaurant, be respectful and avoid acting as a paparazzi. You can read more about Gion and about the difference between maikos and geikos in this [official travel guide](https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e3902.html).
