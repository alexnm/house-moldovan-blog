## Tashkent

We started from the capital of the country, a city of 4 million people and probably the most soviet influenced part of the country. A very green city which definitely doesn't feel like a crowded metropolis, Tashkent has a few interesting sights.

Highlights:

- Hazrati Imam complex, where you can see the 8th century Uthman Quran
- The Second World War Memorial
- Chorsu Market, one of the biggest bazaars in Uzbekistan
- The museum of applied arts

## Khiva

With its iconic blue short tower and the old city gates and walls still intact, Khiva is like a snapshot of past centuries. Squeezed between the Kyzylkum and Karakum deserts in one of the driest parts of the world, Khiva is a beautiful reminder of the pre-modern world. One day gives you plenty of time to wonder around the streets of the old town, enter the royal courtyards and climb the walls for a breathtaking sunset over the city.

Highlights:

- Climbing the high steps of the Islam Hoja Minaret
- Itchan Kala, the walled inner-town
- Walking along the north-western section of the city wall and catching the sunset from above
- Juma Mosque, with its 212 sculpted wooden columns
- Kalta Minor, the blue tower which should have been a minaret but was abandoned

## Bukhara

Perhaps lesser known nowadays compared to Samarkand, but equally beautiful. Bukhara was one of the most important stops on the silk road. From centuries old mosques, to imposing madrasas and busy bazaars, Bukhara certainly delivers.

Highlights:

- The Ark Citadel
- The Kalan Mosque with its landmark minaret
- Mir-i-Arab Madrasa, still functioning today
- Ismail Samani Mausoleum, one of the oldest examples of islamic architecture

## Shahrisabz

On the road from Bukhara to Samarkand, we make a quick stop in the city where Amir Timur was born, at the foothills of the Pamir Mountains which span across the border with Tajikistan.

Highlights:

- The ruins of the colossal palace build by Timur himself
- The entire ensemble of the old city, open as a public park
- The twisty road crossing the mountains towards Samarkand

## Samarkand

Probably the most famous stop on the silk road, Samarkand should be on everyone's bucket list as it is a unique cultural destination.

Highlights:

- Registan square, with the famous madrasas facing each other
- The mausoleum of Timur
- Ulugh-Beg's Observatory
- The Bibi-Khanym Mosque
- The Shan-i-Zinda Necropolis

## Tile Architecture

If there's one thing that stands out in all these cities, it's the beautiful art of tile decoration. Some of the finest examples can be found in Samarkand at the Shan-i-Zinda Necropolis. Nevertheless, countless examples are found in Khiva and Bukhara as well.

## Interior Decorations

As impressive as the outside is, some of these buildings are incredibly decorated inside. The Amir Timur mausoleum is such an example with its blue-gold decoration. Some buildings also follow the same tile decoration that is used for the facades, some feature more wall paintings and Arabic calligraphy.

## Food

All the food here is delicious, comes in huge quantities and is relatively cheap for tourists. They like their spices, which you can buy in the local bazaars, they like their tea with halva or baklava and their national dish is the plov, or beef & rice pilaf. Also they eat a lot of bread and salads.
