## KHIVA

With its iconic blue short tower and the old city gates and walls still intact, Khiva is like a snapshot of past centuries. Squeezed between the Kyzylkum and Karakum deserts in one of the driest parts of the world, Khiva is a beautiful reminder of the pre-modern world. One day gives you plenty of time to wonder around the streets of the old town, enter the royal courtyards and climb the walls for a breathtaking sunset over the city.

## Highlights:

- Climbing the high steps of the Islam Hoja Minaret
- Itchan Kala, the walled inner-town
- Walking along the north-western section of the city wall and catching the sunset from above
- Juma Mosque, with its 212 sculpted wooden columns
- Kalta Minor, the blue tower which should have been a minaret but was abandoned
