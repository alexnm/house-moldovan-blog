## Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires is a city of contrasts: old palaces, new style skyscrapers and colorful colonial architecture. In total, we spent 3 days there, enough to get accustomed to the language and the South American culture, to eat delicious steaks and drink enough glasses of Malbec wine!

First thing you do after a 14 hour flight? Hop on a 4 hour free walking tour through the central part of Buenos Aires! Our guide was really nice, but our tour was big, so we moved slowly through the streets of Recoleta, plaza San Martin and the rest of the central neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires. As the tour ended, we continued our walk around Plaza de Mayo and Puerto Madero.

### Highlights

- Visiting the world renown Teatro Colon
- Recoleta Cemetery and the tomb of Eva Peron
- Plaza de Mayo, with the famous Casa Rosada
- Evening walk along the canal in Puerto Madero
- Heading out to San Telmo on Sunday for the famous flea market
- Great evening with dinner and tango show at Piazzolla Tango
- Heavy porteÃ±o breakfasts at Cafe Tortoni

## La Boca

This neighbourhood deserves its own chapter due to its colorful houses and street art. We took the entire Sunday morning to walk around the relatively small "barrio", before heading to San Telmo.

Highlights

- Stroll along "El Caminito"
- "La Bombonera" Stadium, home of Boca Juniors
- Admire street art around the area, with surprisingly quiet streets for a weekend day

From Buenos Aires, we took a plane to El Calafate and then a transfer to El Chalten. There, we stayed for 3 days, hiking in the mountains around the "capital of hiking" of Argentina. In total, we spent 5 full days in Patagonia, including a day trip to the Chilean side, hiking and sightseeing around some of the most amazing landscapes we ever saw, at the southern end of the world!

## Laguna de los Tres

A hike to Laguna de los Tres is a great way to experience all four seasons in a single day. Welcome to Patagonia! When we arrived in El Chalten in the evening before the hike, the weather was terrible: cold, windy and rainy. The next morning started in a similar manner and Mount Fitz Roy, the "star" of the show, remained in a permanent mist. But by the time we approached the final climb towards the mountain lake, the clouds cleared and we were lucky to see the huge granite wall of the mighty Fitz Roy in front of us, as clear as you can hope to see it, considering the Patagonian weather.

Highlights

- Snowfall in the middle of the summer!
- The first glimpse of the Fitz Roy peak, after 4 hours of hiking
- Arriving at the shore of Laguna de los Tres
- The view of the milky blue Laguna Sucia, which is just below Laguna de los Tres
- Soaring condors around the highest peaks in the area
- The view of the entire mountain range in the evening sun as you hike back towards El Chalten

## Loma del Pliegue Tumbado

If we had only one word to describe this day, it would be: windy. We experienced the most powerful wind in our lives while trying to advance towards the mountain peak, in the middle of the alpine rocky landscape. This hike is not so popular for some reason, so it was a nice change, considering the huge crowd we had the other day. At the end of the hike we were rewarded with the most amazing view over the two mountain ranges that guard El Chalten: with the two peaks of Fitz Roy and Cerro Torre in the background, and the milky brown Laguna Torre and Torre Glacier in the foreground.

Highlights

- Incredibly beautiful trail through the low forests of secular trees
- Trying not to fall as we hiked up the mountain!
- Eating a sandwich at the cover of a rock wall
- The amazing viewpoint of Loma del Pliegue Tumbado

## Lago del Desierto

For our final day in El Chalten, we went for a day trip to Lago del Desierto, close to the Chilean border. Lush vegetation, impressive glaciers and green-blue waters, the whole area around the lake is really beautiful. Weather was not particularly great for hiking, but we were lucky not to get too much rain while doing the short hikes.

Highlights

Green forests with Lenga trees, many of them more than 200 years old
Hiking upstream to the foothills of the Vespigniani glacier
Hiking up to the amazing Huemul glacier with its milky green lake
Hot chocolate and biscuits at the Ecocamp

## Perito Moreno

After we returned to El Calafate, we planned a full day for the amazing Perito Moreno glacier. We booked a tour with Hielo y Aventura, on a day in which we saw the glacier from all possible angles and viewpoints and we embarked on a short hike on the glacier itself!

Highlights

Crossing by boat on Lago Rico, to the foot of the glacier
Ice hiking with crampons, on the white-blue ice, around creases and water streams
Whiskey on the glacier ice!
Getting mesmerised by the sheer size of the glacier, standing a few hundred meters away on the famous balconies, listening to the roar of the ice as it raptured

## Torres del Paine

A single day is not enough to do justice to Torres del Paine National Park, but we enjoyed every moment spent at the foothills of the Cuernos del Paine and Cerro Grand Paine, on the shores of the lakes NordenskjÃ¶ld and Pehoe. We will definitely come back here!

Highlights

The view from Lago Sarmiento as you approach the park
Walking around the heards of Guanacos
The green waters of lake Pehoe
The majestic jump of Salto Grande

Next we flew from El Calafate to Puerto Iguazu (via Buenos Aires), staying for two days to admire one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world: Iguazu Falls. We made sure to have enough time to visit both the Argentinian and the Brazilian side of the falls. We were instantly welcomed with a heavy tropical rain and 35Â°C. Quite a change from the Patagonian weather!

## Iguazu Falls

Long story short: you will get wet! It's hard to describe the falls. Words simply don't do justice! You have to experience being meters away from a 70m fall, getting splashed by the constant water vapors rising from the Devil's Throat, the most famous section of the falls. The Argentinians will say their side is more spectacular because you are inches from the water. The Brazilians will argue that their side is more spectacular as you get the panoramic view of the entire area. We can only recommend that you visit both sides and decide for yourselves!

Highlights

Hiking the Lower and Upper circuits on the Argentinian side
Walking on top of the Devil's Throat, just listening to the roar of the water
Getting lost into the countless rainbows seen around the falls
Spotting the beautiful species of birds, insects and wild animals in the park
Getting that perfect panoramic shot from the Brazilian side of the falls

## Parc de Aves

While you are on the Brazilian side, it is worth taking 1-2hours to visit the bird park, which is right next to the entrance to the national park. We were pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the species inside and by the visiting experience, as you enter the huge aviaries together with the birds and other animal species!

A short stop at a famous landmark in Puerto Iguazu, where you can see the confluence of the Iguazu and Parana rivers, while looking simultaneously at three different cities in three different countries.

From the tropical jungle, our next stop was in central Chile, where we stayed for 5 days. On a clear day, flying towards Santiago, you get a glimpse of the size of the Andes around the central part of Chile and Argentina, with peaks going over 6000m as you are at the regular 10000m altitude. Right under the wing of the plane, you can catch a glimpse at Cerro Aconcagua - 6960m, the highest mountain in the world outside the Himalayan range and the highest peak in the southern and eastern hemispheres.

## Santiago

First time in a new city? Hop on to a free walking tour! We had a great time with our guide, Felipe, walking around the busy streets in the center of the city, getting acquainted with the history and culture around Santiago. In total, we spent 2 days in the city, which is more than enough to get a good feel of it. The weather this time was scorching hot, with 39Â°C in the sun. Luckily, the city is full of parks and pedestrian streets, so overall the experience was pleasant.

Highlights

Walking around Plaza de Armas and the central pedestrian streets of Santiago
La Moneda, the presidential palace
A nice walk around Bellavista, where we found one of Pablo Neruda's houses
The funicular and cable car ride up to Cerro Cristobal with an impressive view of the city
Museum of Memory and Human Rights, commemorating the victims of the Pinochet era
Wine tasting dinner at Bocanariz Restaurant

## Valparaiso

Being in Santiago, we decided to take a day trip to Valparaiso, Chile's port on the Pacific Coast, world renown UNESCO World Heritage city. After a 90 minutes bus trip and a local bus to the old part of the town, we met the free walking tour group and we started going up and down the painted streets of Cerro Alegre and Cerro Concepcion. The city is incredibly contrasting, from artsy painted houses and walls, to sketchy areas and a ton of stray dogs wondering around and following people in the tours. Nevertheless, our guide made sure we felt safe throughout the tour and looking back, the experience was great.

Highlights

Get lost on the colorful streets around Cerro Alegre and Cerro Concepcion
Ride the famous Valparaiso funiculars
Catch a glimpse of the port and the whole coastal area from Cerro Artilleria
Experience the Valparaiso public transport system with all its craziness

## Cajon del Maipo

Being so close to the Andes, we decided to visit the mountain area as well. Our first day was a trip up the Maipo river valley, passing by the canyon and ending up with a great hike to the foothills of the San Jose Volcano. The volcano itself is 5856m high and we hiked up to 3000m on a beautiful sunny day. The whole trip was flawlessly organized by AndoAndes and the guys were really awesome throughout the day. We had 3 guides for a group of 15 people, which says a lot about their dedication to provide quality services.

## Aconcagua National Park

Our next day in the Andes was again full of sunshine and this time we passed back into Argentina, on our way to the famous Aconcagua mountain and the national park with the same name. On the way, we stopped at Puente del Inca, a natural stone monument carved by the mountain stream. We had a smaller group this time, but we did waste a bit of time at the border controls in and out of Argentina. The landscape on the valley leading to Aconcagua is amazing and we had a 2 hour hike at around 3200m, with very little elevation, just enough to stretch our legs and get sleepy from the lack of oxygen. On the way back, we stopped on the Chilean side at Portillo, a famous sky resort extensively used by professional skiers during the summer season in the northern hemisphere.

## Montevideo

Uruguay is pretty different compared to the other countries we visited and feels much more peaceful and safer. We had plenty of time in Montevideo to visit the old town, the beach and generally just to enjoy the city. However, the plan for the final days was to relax more, so we took it easy.

Highlights

Sun bathing at Pocitos Beach
Plaza Independencia with the impressive Palacio Salvo, the symbol of Montevideo
Free walking tour around Ciudad Vieja, with its nicely laid pedestrian streets
Mercado del Puerto, the fish market next to the port

## Colonia del Sacramento

On the way back to Buenos Aires as we crossed Rio de la Plata by ferry, we made our last stop in Colonia del Sacramento. We booked our trip in such a way that we had 3 hours to kill in the small picturesque town before heading back to Argentina for our flight home. Colonia is a Portuguese colony from the 17th century and has a UNESCO Heritage old town with the preserved colonial architecture.

Highlights

Calle de los Suspiros and similar streets around the small old town
Walking around with a feeling that the time is stopped
The Lighthouse of Colonia
Classic cars parked on the small cobbled streets
