## ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·BUENOS AIRES

Buenos Aires is a city of contrasts: old palaces, new style skyscrapers and colorful colonial architecture. In total, we spent 3 days there, enough to get accustomed to the language and the South American culture, to eat delicious steaks and drink enough glasses of Malbec wine!

First thing you do after a 14 hour flight? Hop on a 4 hour free walking tour through the central part of Buenos Aires! Our guide was really nice, but our tour was big, so we moved slowly through the streets of Recoleta, plaza San Martin and the rest of the central neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires. As the tour ended, we continued our walk around Plaza de Mayo and Puerto Madero.

### Highlights

- Visiting the world renown Teatro Colon
- Recoleta Cemetery and the tomb of Eva Peron
- Plaza de Mayo, with the famous Casa Rosada
- Evening walk along the canal in Puerto Madero
- Heading out to San Telmo on Sunday for the famous flea market
- Great evening with dinner and tango show at Piazzolla Tango
- Heavy porteÃ±o breakfasts at Cafe Tortoni
