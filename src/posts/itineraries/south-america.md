## Days 1-2: Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires is a city of contrasts: old palaces, new style skyscrapers and colorful colonial architecture. In total, we spent a bit more than 2 days there, enough to get accustomed to the language and the South American culture, to eat delicious steaks and drink enough glasses of Malbec wine!

First thing you do after a 14 hour flight? Hop on a 4 hour free walking tour through the central part of Buenos Aires! Our guide was really nice, but our tour was big, so we moved slowly through the streets of Recoleta, plaza San Martin and the rest of the central neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires. As the tour ended, we continued our walk around Plaza de Mayo and Puerto Madero.

A very good way to start your day in Buenos Aires is with a typical (and heavy) porteÃ±o breakfast at [Cafe Tortoni](http://www.cafetortoni.com.ar/en/). That's what we also decided to do, early in the morning, to get ready for a lot of walking through the streets of **La Boca**.

This neighbourhood almost deserves its own chapter, due to its colorful houses and street art. We took the entire Sunday morning to walk around the relatively small "barrio", before heading to San Telmo. 

Something that you don't want to miss while in Buenos Aires is a tango show. Even if it might seem to be a tourist trap, if you choose a good one, you'll get to see authentic argentinian tango and listen to local musicians in a very nice atmosphere. We opted for a dinner and tango show at [Teatro Astor Piazzolla](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g312741-d807816-Reviews-Teatro_Astor_Piazzolla-Buenos_Aires_Capital_Federal_District.html) and fully enjoyed it.

### Highlights 

#### Central Buenos Aires
- Visiting the world renown Teatro Colon
- Recoleta Cemetery and the tomb of Eva Peron
- Plaza de Mayo, with the famous Casa Rosada
- Evening walk along the canal in Puerto Madero
- Heading out to San Telmo on Sunday for the famous flea market
- Great evening with dinner and tango show at Piazzolla Tango
- Heavy porteÃ±o breakfasts at Cafe Tortoni

#### La Boca
- Stroll along "El Caminito"
- "La Bombonera" Stadium, home of Boca Juniors
- Admire street art around the area, with surprisingly quiet streets for a weekend day

## Days 3-6: El Chalten

From Buenos Aires, we took a plane to El Calafate and then a transfer to El Chalten. There, we stayed for 3 days, hiking in the mountains around the "capital of hiking" of Argentina. In total, we spent 5 full days in Patagonia, including a day trip to the Chilean side, hiking and sightseeing around some of the most amazing landscapes we ever saw, at the southern end of the world!

In El Chalten, we were very lucky and had good weather for hiking, so we were able to see Laguna de los Tres, Loma del Pliegue Tumbado and also Lago del Desierto. For more details on these, see our [Hiking in El Chalten](/travel/hiking-in-el-chalten/) spotlight article.

After our trip to Lago Del Desierto, we took a bus back to El Calafate, where we "set camp" for the next 3 nights.

## Day 7: Perito Moreno

The must-do thing while in El Calafate is go to the amazing Perito Moreno glacier. We booked a tour with [Hielo y Aventura](https://hieloyaventura.com/en/tour/minitrekking-en/), on a day in which we saw the glacier from all possible angles and viewpoints and we embarked on a short hike on the glacier itself!

Highlights

- Crossing by boat on Lago Rico, to the foot of the glacier
- Ice hiking with crampons, on the white-blue ice, around creases and water streams
- Whiskey on the glacier ice!
- Getting mesmerised by the sheer size of the glacier, standing a few hundred meters away on the famous balconies, listening to the roar of the ice as it raptured

## Day 8: Torres del Paine

A single day is not enough to do justice to Torres del Paine National Park, but we enjoyed every moment spent at the foothills of the Cuernos del Paine and Cerro Grand Paine, on the shores of the lakes NordenskjÃ¶ld and Pehoe. We will definitely come back here!

Highlights

- The view from Lago Sarmiento as you approach the park
- Walking around the heards of Guanacos
- The green waters of lake Pehoe
- The majestic jump of Salto Grande

## Days 9-11: Iguazu Falls

After so much hiking and the cold Patagonian weather (while being in the middle of the Argentinian summer), we spent one day travelling to the tropical lands. We flew from El Calafate to Puerto Iguazu (via Buenos Aires), and were welcomed with a heavy tropical rain and 35Â°C.

In total, we spent two days to admire one of the most spectacular waterfalls in the world: Iguazu Falls. We made sure to have enough time to visit both the Argentinian and the Brazilian side of the falls.

### The Waterfall Experience

Long story short: you will get wet! It's hard to describe the falls. Words simply don't do justice! You have to experience being meters away from a 70m fall, getting splashed by the constant water vapors rising from the Devil's Throat, the most famous section of the falls. The Argentinians will say their side is more spectacular because you are inches from the water. The Brazilians will argue that their side is more spectacular as you get the panoramic view of the entire area. We can only recommend that you visit both sides and decide for yourselves!

#### The Argentinian Side

There are two main circuits that you can walk on: the lower and upper circuits. As their name suggests, they are in both the lower and upper parts of the waterfalls. You need a full day to cover them, but it's worth it: both are spectacular. From the lower ones, you get to see a panoramic view of the falls complex, while from the upper circuit you get to really experience the waterfalls in the most attractive point: hear the roar and get wet on top of the Devil's Throat.

#### The Brazilian Side

While the entrance queue in the Argentinian side was quite fast, it took us a bit more to get inside the Brazilian one. 

The first step is to take a bus from Puerto Iguazu. There are a lot of them, every 10-15 minutes, but you can't buy tickets one day in advance. Make sure to get there as early as possible, as it gets crowded later in the day. The bus takes you to Brasil, so make sure you have your passport with you. Also, check in advance if you need a visa. The process of crossing the border, although a bit confusing, goes quite smooth, and in about an hour you are at the entrance of the Iguazu Falls national park.

There, you need to buy a ticket, then wait in a queue for another bus that takes you closer to the waterfalls. We had to wait for about an hour for the bus, but it was worth it in the end, as the weather was hot and the entire trip (one way) is of about 15km. When you get off the bus, you're almost on the track to the falls.

Walking around takes about 2 hours, and the highpoint of this side is getting to see the Devil's Throat from below. You also get really close to the water, so you'll most probably get wet (again :D).

While you are on the Brazilian side, it is worth taking 1-2 hours to visit the bird park, which is right next to the entrance to the national park. We were pleasantly surprised by the beauty of the species inside and by the visiting experience, as you enter the huge aviaries together with the birds and other animal species!

Highlights

- Hiking the Lower and Upper circuits on the Argentinian side
- Walking on top of the Devil's Throat, just listening to the roar of the water
- Getting lost into the countless rainbows seen around the falls
- Spotting the beautiful species of birds, insects and wild animals in the park
- Getting that perfect panoramic shot from the Brazilian side of the falls

### Las Tres Fronteras

In the same day, before heading out to the airport, we took a short stop at a famous landmark in Puerto Iguazu, where you can see the confluence of the Iguazu and Parana rivers, while looking simultaneously at three different cities in three different countries.

This is quite easy to arrange with your taxi driver, it's not expensive and they'll take you to see all the border from the best spots.

## Days 12-16 Central Chile

From the tropical jungle, our next stop was in central Chile, where we stayed for 5 days. On a clear day, flying towards Santiago, you get a glimpse of the size of the Andes around the central part of Chile and Argentina, with peaks going over 6000m as you are at the regular 10000m altitude. Right under the wing of the plane, you can catch a glimpse at Cerro Aconcagua - 6960m, the highest mountain in the world outside the Himalayan range and the highest peak in the southern and eastern hemispheres.

### Santiago

First time in a new city? Hop on to a free walking tour! We had a great time with our guide, Felipe, walking around the busy streets in the center of the city, getting acquainted with the history and culture around Santiago. In total, we spent 2 days in the city, which is more than enough to get a good feel of it. The weather this time was scorching hot, with 39Â°C in the sun. Luckily, the city is full of parks and pedestrian streets, so overall the experience was pleasant.

Highlights

- Walking around Plaza de Armas and the central pedestrian streets of Santiago
- La Moneda, the presidential palace
- A nice walk around Bellavista, where we found one of Pablo Neruda's houses
- The funicular and cable car ride up to Cerro Cristobal with an impressive view of the city
- Museum of Memory and Human Rights, commemorating the victims of the Pinochet era
- Wine tasting dinner at Bocanariz Restaurant

### Cajon del Maipo

Being so close to the Andes, we decided to visit the mountain area as well. We wanted to alternate the days in the city with the ones outside it, so spent our second day "in Santiago" outside it actually. We took a trip up the Maipo river valley, passing by the canyon and ending up with a great hike to the foothills of the San Jose Volcano. The volcano itself is 5856m high and we hiked up to 3000m on a beautiful sunny day. The whole trip was flawlessly organized by [AndoAndes](https://www.andoandes.cl/) and the guys were really awesome throughout the day. We had 3 guides for a group of 15 people, which says a lot about their dedication to provide quality services.

### Valparaiso

For our next "inside the city" day, we decided to take a trip to Valparaiso, Chile's port on the Pacific Coast, world renown UNESCO World Heritage city. After a 90 minutes bus trip and a local bus to the old part of the town, we met the free walking tour group and we started going up and down the painted streets of Cerro Alegre and Cerro Concepcion. The city is incredibly contrasting, from artsy painted houses and walls, to sketchy areas and a ton of stray dogs wondering around and following people in the tours. Nevertheless, our guide made sure we felt safe throughout the tour and looking back, it was a great experience.

Highlights

- Get lost on the colorful streets around Cerro Alegre and Cerro Concepcion
- Ride the famous Valparaiso funiculars
- Catch a glimpse of the port and the whole coastal area from Cerro Artilleria
- Experience the Valparaiso public transport system with all its craziness

### Aconcagua National Park

Our next day was again in the Andes, and it was again full of sunshine. This time we passed back into Argentina, on our way to the famous Aconcagua mountain and the national park with the same name. On the way, we stopped at Puente del Inca, a natural stone monument carved by the mountain stream. We had a smaller group this time, but we did waste a bit of time at the border controls in and out of Argentina. The landscape on the valley leading to Aconcagua is amazing and we had a 2 hour hike at around 3200m, with very little elevation, just enough to stretch our legs and get sleepy from the lack of oxygen. On the way back, we stopped on the Chilean side at Portillo, a famous sky resort extensively used by professional skiers during the summer season in the northern hemisphere.

## Days 17-19 Uruguay

Uruguay is pretty different compared to the other countries we visited and feels much more peaceful and safer. People are usually very open minded and into well-being, and that's visible even in the smaller things, like free wifi in the city centers.

### Montevideo

New city? Free walking tour :) We did the same in Montevideo. The group was quite big this time too, but it was worth it, as we found out a lot about the history of Uruguay, while also visiting the old town. 

Something to note is that in Uruguay the beef steak is as good as in Argentina, so we made sure we had plenty of it, along with good red local wine.

Two days were enough to see the old city, the port, the beach and generally just to enjoy the city. However, the plan for the final days was to relax more, so we took it easy. 

Highlights

- Sun bathing at Pocitos Beach
- Plaza Independencia with the impressive Palacio Salvo, the symbol of Montevideo
- Free walking tour around Ciudad Vieja, with its nicely laid pedestrian streets
- Mercado del Puerto, the fish market next to the port

### Colonia del Sacramento

On the way back to Buenos Aires as we crossed Rio de la Plata by ferry, we made our last stop in Colonia del Sacramento. We booked our trip in such a way that we had 3 hours to kill in the small picturesque town before heading back to Argentina for our flight home. Colonia is a Portuguese colony from the 17th century and has a UNESCO Heritage old town with the preserved colonial architecture.

Highlights

- Calle de los Suspiros and similar streets around the small old town
- Walking around with a feeling that the time is stopped
- The Lighthouse of Colonia
- Classic cars parked on the small cobbled streets
